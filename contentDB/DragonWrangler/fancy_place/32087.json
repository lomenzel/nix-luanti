  "long_description": "# Fancy Place Mod - User Guide\n\n## What does this mod do?\n\nThe Fancy Place mod makes building easier by showing \"ghost blocks\" - transparent preview blocks that appear next to existing blocks. You can right-click these ghost blocks to place your blocks exactly where you want them!\n\n## Key Feature\n\n-  **Ghost Block Preview**: See exactly where your block will be placed\n-  \n## How to Use\n\n1. **Hold a block** in your hand (any placeable block)\n2. **Look near existing blocks** - you'll see transparent \"ghost blocks\" appear\n3. **Right-click a ghost block** to place your block there\n4. **That's it!** The block is placed and the ghost block disappears\n\n## Customizing the Mod\n\n### Available Settings\n```\nfancy_place_ghost_opacity = 128        # Ghost transparency (0-255)\nfancy_place_ghost_glow = 8             # Ghost glow intensity (0-15)  \nfancy_place_ghost_size = 1.02          # Ghost size multiplier (1.0-1.1)\nfancy_place_reach_distance = 4.5       # How far you can place (1.0-4.5)\nfancy_place_allow_diagonal = true      # Allow diagonal placement\nfancy_place_play_sounds = true         # Play placement sounds\nfancy_place_update_interval = 0.2      # Update frequency in seconds\nfancy_place_instant_updates = true     # Instant ghost block updates\nfancy_place_show_config = false        # Show config in server log\n```\n\n## Configuration Options\n\n### Ghost Block Appearance\n- **Opacity**: How transparent the ghost blocks are (0-255)\n- **Glow**: How much the ghost blocks glow (0-15)\n- **Size**: How much bigger ghost blocks appear than normal blocks\n\n### Placement Behavior\n- **Reach Distance**: How far you can place blocks\n- **Diagonal Placement**: Whether to show ghost blocks diagonally\n- **Placement Sounds**: Whether to play sounds when placing blocks\n\n### Performance Settings\n- **Update Interval**: How often ghost blocks update\n- **Instant Updates**: Whether ghost blocks update immediately\n- **Max Ghost Blocks**: Maximum number of ghost blocks per player\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Ghost blocks are too hard to see\n- Increase `GHOST_OPACITY` (try 180-200)\n- Increase `GHOST_GLOW` (try 12-15)\n- Increase `GHOST_SIZE` (try 1.03-1.05)\n\n### Ghost blocks are too distracting\n- Decrease `GHOST_OPACITY` (try 80-100)\n- Decrease `GHOST_GLOW` (try 3-5)\n- Decrease `GHOST_SIZE` (try 1.01)\n\n### Performance issues\n- Set `INSTANT_UPDATES = false`\n- Increase `UPDATE_INTERVAL` to 0.5\n### Ghost blocks don't appear\n- Make sure you're holding a placeable block\n- Make sure you're looking near existing solid blocks\n- Make sure you aren't lagging\n## Tips for Best Experience\n\n1. **Start with defaults** - The default settings work well for most players\n2. **Adjust opacity first** - This has the biggest visual impact\n3. **Test in creative mode** - Easier to experiment with different blocks\n4. **Consider your playstyle** - Builders might want higher opacity, casual players might prefer subtle\n5. **Performance matters** - If you have a slower computer, use the Performance preset\n\n## Support\n\nIf you encounter issues:\n1. Check this guide first\n2. Try the default settings\n3. Look at the terminal/log for error messages\n4. Report bugs with specific details about what you were doing\n\nEnjoy building with Fancy Place!",
