Unzip the archive\n2. place it in minetest/mods/\n\n(  GNU/Linux: If you use a system-wide installation place\n\tit in ~/.minetest/mods/.  )\n\n(  If you only want this to be used in a single world, place\n\tthe folder in worldmods/ in your worlddirectory.  )\n\nFor further information or help see:\nhttps://wiki.minetest.net/Installing_Mods\n\n# Reason for creating\nMinetest already has give command that works in most cases but there are special cases, one of which is book.\n\nYou can give book, and written book, but how would you give a book with text already inside? Or a book with enchantement (from mineclone), or enchanted armor (from mineclone).\n\nOn one server there was a cool idea to use in game books to deliver information to players like server rules or news. The problem is that they had to be given automatically using command block, but refilled manually, and there was no way to control how many books a person takes.\n\nThis mod solves refil problem, the problem of controlling amount is much more complex and is solved only partially using `once` flag.\n\n","maintainers":["zeronumbers"],"media_license":"LGPL-2.1-or-later","name":"copy_from_chest","provides":["copy_from_chest"],"release":22955,"repo":"https://github.com/zeronumbers/copy-from-chest","score":1.9,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/a25884effa.png"],"short_description":"Adds server command copy-from-chest that copies items from chest at x y z to player.","state":"APPROVED","tags":["chat"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/a25884effa.png","title":"Copy From Chest","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/zeronumbers/copy_from_chest/releases/22955/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"zeronumbers/copy_from_chest":[]},"hash":"0sb4gwl032n9il8ax1nddpcraa2gl719vaxzj3bcqm1qfg9a1c61"}
