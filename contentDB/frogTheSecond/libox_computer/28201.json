  "long_description": "# Libox_computer\n\n### A mod that has  \n##### Libox laptop  \n A sort of... luacontroller i guess you could say... with a digistuff touchscreen on top  \n Inspired by the lwcomputers mod, `but without the horrible text inputting` and without the filesystem stuff\n\n##### Libox robot\n Like the libox laptop, but has an inventory and can interract with the world\n\n# Differences from luacontroller\n\n- The sandbox is inside a *coroutine*\n  - What that means is you can stop the sandbox at any time, and resume from that point\n  - This is how the libox computer handles events\n  - When the sandbox errors or stops, it dies\n- If the sandbox is not found (say, during a digiline or a gui event) then it will \"wake up\"\n  - What that means is it will start the sandbox again, `mem` will still be kept as it was before, you can't kill and start sandboxes in a short time frame, limit is configured by settings\n- Has the [mt-mod's digistuff touchscreen protocol](https://github.com/mt-mods/digistuff/blob/master/docs/touchscreen.md) built in\n  - And has even some extra commands\n- Uses libox, and environment is mostly handled by libox\n  - This means you get extra stuffs to play with and also the sandbox is limited by time, not instructions\n- Attempts to do coroutine sandboxes securely\n  - But minetest mod security doesn't allow us to weigh the local variables and upvalues of the environment, so libox needs to be a trusted mod for that to work (optional)\n\n\n**More in [DOCS.md](https://github.com/TheEt1234/libox_computer/blob/master/DOCS.md)**\n\n# Support\n\n- mesecons_debug: limiting works fully because this mod uses mesecon queue, no extra things needed\n- mesecons: only uses it for some utility functions (like mesecon queue and heat), doesn't support mesecons I/O\n- digilines: the laptop has digilines I/O\n- luatool: All luatool's features are supported here\n- wrench: You can pick it up with a wrench\n- pipeworks: Robot uses pipeworks for inventory automation (receiving/sending items)\n\n### This mod uses code from other mods, see [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/TheEt1234/libox_computer/blob/master/LICENSE.md)\n\n\n# Todos (not in order)\n\n- better code\n- T E S T S\n- maybe more robot features (autocrafting :?)\n\n\n# Common troubleshooting\n- The sandbox doesn't weigh local variables\n    - You need to add libox to trusted mods for it to expose and use `debug.getlocal` and `debug.getupvalue` and use those to weigh the sandbox\n\n# What wont be happening\n- mesecon interraction: i feel like it would be too complicated to rewrite the code to support that at this point\n- setfenv/getfenv: i am afraid of messing that up... like that could lead to some actual full minetest server control\n- metatables: you can hide values inside them, oh and `getmetatable()` is not that fast so weighing things would be slow *(needs to be verified actually)*, and also i just feel like they can be used to do some nasty stuff\n\n# What to report as a bug\n\n- If it's not covered in the common troubleshooting page and feels un-intended or abusable, then please report it as a bug\n- If you can hide some data inside userdata, ***it's a bug***\n    - if you obtain userdata that you can write unlimited data to directly, it's probably a bug\n\n# Things open to discussion\n- The crafing recipe **CURRENTLY LACKS A CRAFTING RECIPE**\n- The defaults\n- The looks\n- ok really anything...",
