  "long_description": "# Glamorous Deaths\n\nA Minetest mod to give your deaths some pizzazz with messages. A fork of\nEvergreenTree's [death_messages](https://github.com/4Evergreen4/death_messages)\nwith fixes and improvements. That mod heroically attempted death reasons\nthrough guesswork since the Minetest API didn't give death reasons. Now we can\ndo better!\n\nThis mod announces a player's death server-wide. You might recall such behavior\nfrom a certain popular mining game or an old-school shooter. The messages are\nrandomizedâ€¦ Unless you don't want that; One can configure the mod to only use\nthe finest message available for each particular death.\n\n_Glamorous Deaths_ uses the internal Minetest API to determine which message to\nuse. For instance, falling in lava will generate different messages than\ndrowning. Additionally, if the player is killed by another player or entity\n(such as a mob) then it will display the name in a human-friendly way.\n\n## License\n\nGPLv3 (see LICENSE)\n\n## Installation\n\nThere are no dependencies, so merely install via the Minetest content manager\nor [follow the official instructions to install mods](https://wiki.minetest.net/Installing_Mods).\n\n\n## Changelog\nView changes for each release at the [upstream releases page](https://git.sr.ht/~ainola/minetest-glamorous-deaths/refs).\n\n## Submitting issues\n\nThe project is hosted on [sh.rt](https://git.sr.ht/~ainola/minetest-glamorous-deaths/). Report issues on the accompanying [issue tracker](https://todo.sr.ht/~ainola/minetest-glamorous-deaths).\n",
