  "long_description": "This adds a new tier of tools and armor, as well as some decorative blocks.Like gold but last longer and in pink! Rose Gold Ore is made with one copper ore, two gold ore, one blaze powder , and one nether quartz crystal in a 3x3 crafting grid. It can then be smelted into ingots.\n\nRose Gold tier tools have similar properties to regular gold in speed and enchantability but signifigantly more durability around that of iron. It uses some nether crafting components to balance it as a later-game material that improves on regular golds main weakness of poor durability.\n\nRose Gold Blocks oxidize like their copper counterpart turning from pinkish gold to blue and purple.\n\nRose gold lanterns and chains can also be made for lighting and decoration.\n",
