  "long_description": "# Draigh-uisge means in Scottish Gaelic a Water Dragon.\n\n**Water Dragons:** This mod introduces three types of Dragons — the Pure Water Dragon, the Rare Water Dragon, and the Scottish Dragon.

There are many features to discover — some of them are quite special, like the one that lets you talk to Water Dragons.\n\n**Draconic Blocks:** The mod features various decorative and functional blocks, including Draconic Bricks, Draconic Stone, and more.\n\n**Water-Forged Draconic Tools and Armour:** Forge powerful gear from `Water-Forged Draconic Steel`.
