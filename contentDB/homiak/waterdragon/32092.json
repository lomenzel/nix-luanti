  "long_description": "# Dragan-uisge means in Scottish Gaelic a Water Dragon.\n\n**Water Dragons**\nThis mod introduces three types of Dragons — the Pure Water Dragon, the Rare Water Dragon, and the Scottish Dragon. Each has some unique abilities, such as creating healing water and glowing at night.\n\n**Useful things**\nWater Dragons can rescue players in danger. There are many features to discover — some of them are quite special, like the one that lets you talk to Water Dragons.\n\n**Draconic Blocks**\nThe mod features various decorative and functional blocks, including Draconic Bricks, Draconic Stone, and more.\n\n**Water-Forged Draconic Tools and Armour**\nForge powerful gear from `Water-Forged Draconic Steel`. The armour offers great protection in battles, and the tools — forged in Dragon Water — are incredibly powerful, capable of killing some enemies in a single hit.\n\n## Chatcommands\n- *call_wtd <radius>*   --   Calls the nearest Water Dragon within the specified radius (default is 100) and teleports it to you.\n- *set_wtd_owner <player_name>*   --   Sets the owner of the pointed Water Dragon.\n- *wtd_blacklist_add <player_name>*   --   Adds a player to the Water Dragon Attack Blacklist.\n- *wtd_blacklist_remove <player_name>*   --   Removes a player from the Water Dragon Attack Blacklist.\n- *wtd_blacklist_show*   --   Shows all players currently in the Blacklist.\n- *talk_wtd*   --   Start a conversation with the nearest Water Dragon.\n- *wtd_mount_settings*   --   Opens the Water Dragon mount settings form.\n- *autopilot*   --   Toggles the Water Dragon’s autopilot mode when mounted.\n\n\n## Dragon Dialogue commands\n- *take me to <x, y, z>* - The Dragon transports the player to specific coordinates.\n- *bring me to <dragon_name>* - The Water Dragon brings you to another Dragon with the specified name.\n- *fire* - The Dragon unleashes a powerful water breath attack in the forward direction, damaging enemies and potentially affecting the environment.\n- *attack* - The Water Dragon attacks whatever target the player is looking at, except for other Dragons and players.\n- *fly* - The Water Dragon takes off and performs a circular flight pattern.\n- *land* - The Dragon descends and lands on the ground.\n\t\n- stop - The Dragon halts all current actions.\n- *stay* - The Dragon remains at its current position.\n- *wander* - Allows the Dragon to move around freely in the area.\n- *follow* - The Dragon follows the player during its travels.\n- *roar* - The Dragon emits a powerful roar.\n- *come here* - The Dragon flies directly to the player.\n- *ride* - Allows the player to mount and ride the Water Dragon.\n\t\n\t\n## Installation\nInstall via the `Luanti Mod Menu`, or download from `ContentDB`.\n\nMore details can be found in the `Book about Water Dragons` — it's included in this mod, just search for it in your inventory.\n\nYou’re also welcome to join the server at IP `85.215.240.79 - Scotland the Brave` to test everything in action.\n\nThis mod is based on [Draconis](https://github.com/ElCeejo/draconis) and [Creatura](https://github.com/ElCeejo/creatura) and created by **Scottii**.\n\n# Release log\n\n### Release v5.0.0\n- Added the Water Dragon Eye craftitem\n- Added the [official website](https://homiak.github.io/waterdragon/)\n\n### Release v 4.6.1\n- Fix the taming utility bug - you are now able to tame Water Dragons the same way as Scottish Dragons\n\t\n### Release v 4.6.0\n- Fixed bugs\n- Minor tweaks with \"take me to\" command\n\n### Release v 4.5.1\n- Fixed the bug with undefined variable \"winddragon\"\n- Added more conversations to the Dragon dialogue\n\t\n### Release v 4.5.0\n- Fixed bugs\n- Fixed grammatical errors\n\n### Release v 4.4.0\n- Fixed bugs\n- Fixed shoulder mount bug\n\n### Release v 4.3.0\n- Fixed bugs\n\n### Release v 4.2.0\n- Fixed bugs\n- Removed Scottish Dragon Crate\n- Added the ability to store Scottish Dragons in Dragon Horns\n\n### Release v 4.1.0\n- Fixed bugs\n\n### Release v 4.0.1\n- Fixed bugs\n\n### Release v 4.0.0\n- Core Integration\n- Fixed bugs\n\n### Release v 3.1.0\n- Fixed bugs\n- Fixed Scottish Dragon mounting\n- Added Wing Horn throwing\n- Better bowing\n\n### Release v 3.0.0\n- Added the Water Dragon Armour\n- Fixed bugs\n- Added the rescue behavior for Pegasi (mod: [Pegasus](https://github.com/homiak/pegasus))\n- Fixed slam\n- Minor tweaks\n\n### Release v 2.3.1\n- Fixed bugs\n\n### Release v 2.2.0\n- Fixed bugs\n- Added shields\n- A new function for the Scottish Dragon Crate\n- Added the Water Dragon Eye craftitem\n- Added bowing\n- Added healing water\n\n### Release v 2.1.0\n- Addde the Scottish Water Dragon\n- Fixed bugs\n- Fixed translation\n- Fixed Wing Horn\n- A new setting\n- A new chatcommand\n\n### Release v. 1.1.0\n- Added the throwable Wing Horn\n- A new chatcomannd - call_wtd\n- Fixed bugs\n- Fixed view points\n- Translation\n\n### Release v 1.0.0\n- Initial release\n",
