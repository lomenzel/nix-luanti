  "long_description": "### Description:\n\nA continuation of the [whinny mod](https://forum.luanti.org/viewtopic.php?t=17170) that adds tameable & rideable horses.\n\n### Usage:\n\nWild horses can be tamed by feeding them items that they like, such as apples, carrots, wheat, & oats. Once the horse's appetite has been satisfied it becomes \"tamed\" & the player feeding it becomes the owner. Tamed/Owned horses can only be ridden, picked up, & killed by the owner. Currently, the `mobs:lasso` item is supported for picking up (plans to add more items).\n\nTo ride tamed horse, right-click (place action) the entity to mount it. Use the W/S keys for forward/reverse. There are two modes for steering:\n\n- mouse (follows player facing direction) (default)\n- A/D keys\n\nControls can be changed by setting `mount_turn_player_look` in the configuration.\n\nRight-click again to dismount. Tamed horses do not wander.\n\n### Links:\n\n- [Changelog](https://codeberg.org/AntumLuanti/mod-whinny/src/commit/master/changelog.txt)\n- [TODO](https://codeberg.org/AntumLuanti/mod-whinny/src/commit/master/TODO.txt)\n",
