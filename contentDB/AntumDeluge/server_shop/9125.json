The two shop nodes are `server_shop:shop_small` & `server_shop:shop_large` (they function identically).\n\n---\n### Licensing\n\n- Code: [MIT](https://github.com/AntumMT/mod-server_shop/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)\n- Textures: CC0\n\n---\n### Usage\n\n---\n##### Registering Shops via API\n\nThere are two types of shops, seller & buyer. A seller shop can be registered with `server_shop.register_seller(id, name, products)`. A buyer with `server_shop.register_buyer(id, name, def)`. `id` is a string identifier associated with the shop list. `name` is a human-readable string that will be displayed as the shop's title. `products` is the shop list definition. Shop lists are defined in a table of tuples in `{itemname, value}` format. `itemname` is the technical string name of an item (e.g. `default:wood`). `value` is the number representation of what the item is worth.\n\n*Example:*\n```lua\n-- register seller\nserver_shop.register_seller(\"frank\", \"Frank's Shop\", {{\"default:wood\", 2}})\n\n-- register buyer\nserver_shop.register_buyer(\"julie\", \"Julie's Shop\",  {\n\t{\"default:copper_lump\", 5},\n\t{\"default:iron_lump\", 6},\n})\n```\n\n---\n##### Registering Shops via Configuration\n\nShops can optionally be configured in `<world_path>/server_shops.json` file. To register a shop, set `type` to \"sell\" or \"buy\". `id` is a string identifier for the shop. `name` is the string displayed in the formspec & when a player points at the node. `products` is an array of products sold at the shop in format \"name,value\".\n\n*Example:*\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"type\":\"sell\",\n    \"id\":\"frank\",\n    \"name\":\"Frank's Shop\",\n    \"products\":[[\"default:wood\",2]]\n  },\n  {\n    \"type\":\"buy\",\n    \"id\":\"julie\",\n    \"name\":\"Julie's Shop\",\n    \"products\":\n    [\n      [\"default:copper_lump\",5],\n      [\"default:iron_lump\",6],\n    ]\n  },\n]\n```\n\n---\n##### Registering Shops via Chat Command\n\nThe `server_shop` chat command is available to administrators with the `server` privilege. This is used for administering shops & updating configuration.\n\nUsage:\n```\n/server_shop <command> [<params>]\n\n# Commands:\n\n/server_shop reload\n- reloads data from configuration file\n\n/server_shop register <id> <type> <name> [product1=value,product2=value,...]\n- registers a shop & updates configuration file\n- parameters:\n  - id: shop identifier\n  - type: can be \"buy\" or \"sell\"\n  - name: displayed shop name (\"_\" is replaced with \" \")\n\t- product list: comma-separated list in format \"item=value\"\n\n/server_shop unregister <id>\n- unregisters a shop & updates configuration file\n- parameters:\n  - id: shop identifier\n```\n\n---\n##### Registering Currencies\n\nCurrencies can be registered with `server_shop.register_currency`:\n```lua\nserver_shop.register_currency(\"currency:minegeld\", 1)\nserver_shop.register_currency(\"currency:minegeld_5\", 5)\n```\n\nWhen registering a new currency in `server_shops.json`, set `type` to \"currency\". `name` is the item to be used as currency & `value` is the item's worth:\n```json\n\t{\n\t\t\"type\":\"currency\",\n\t\t\"name\":\"currency:minegeld\",\n\t\t\"value\":1,\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\t\"type\":\"currency\",\n\t\t\"name\":\"currency:minegeld_5\",\n\t\t\"value\":5,\n\t},\n```\n\n***Notes:***\n\n- *Only currency values of 1, 5, 10, 50, & 100 are currently supported*\n- *Buyer shops currently do not work with custom currencies, only minegeld notes from currency mod supported*\n\nYou can also register a currency suffix to be displayed in the formspec. Simply set the string value of `server_shop.currency_suffix`:\n\n```lua\nserver_shop.currency_suffix = \"MG\"\n```\n\nIn `server_shops.json`, set `type` to \"suffix\" & `value` to the string to be displayed:\n```json\n\t{\n\t\t\"type\":\"suffix\",\n\t\t\"value\":\"MG\",\n\t},\n```\n\nBy default, if the [currency][mod.currency] mod is installed, the minegeld notes will be registered as currency. This can be disabled by setting `server_shop.use_currency_defaults` to `false` in `minetest.conf`.\n\n---\n##### Setting up Shops in Game:\n\nServer admins use the chat command `/giveme server_shop:shop_small` or `/giveme server_shop:shop_large` to receive a shop node. After placing the node, the ID can be set with the \"Set ID\" button & text input field (only players with the \"server\" privilege can set ID). Set the ID to the registered shop ID you want associated with this node (\"frank\" or \"julie\" for the examples above) & the list will be populated with the registered products & prices.\n\n---\n##### Using Seller Shops:\n\nTo make purchases, player first deposits registered currency items into the deposit slot. Select an item in the products list & press the \"Buy\" button. If there is adequate money deposited, player will receive the item & the cost will be deducted from the deposited amount. To retrieve any money not spent, press the \"Refund\" button. If the formspec is closed while there is still a deposit balance, the remaining money will be refunded back to the player. If there is not room in the player's inventory, the remaining balance will be dropped on the ground.\n\n---\n##### Using Buyer Shops:\n\nFor buyer shops, the product list shows what items can be sold to this shop & how much money a player will receive for each item. To sell to the shop, place an item in the deposit slot. The slot will only accept items that the owner will purchase. Press the \"Sell\" button to recieve the value of the item(s).\n\n---\n### Requirements:\n\nPrivileges:\n\n- `server` (for setting shop ID)\n\n---\n### Links:\n\n- [Reference](https://antummt.github.io/mod-server_shop/reference/latest/)\n- [Changelog](https://github.com/AntumMT/mod-server_shop/blob/master/changelog.txt)\n- [TODO](https://github.com/AntumMT/mod-server_shop/blob/master/TODO.txt)\n\n\n[mod.currency]: https://content.minetest.net/packages/VanessaE/currency/","maintainers":["AntumDeluge"],"media_license":"CC0-1.0","name":"server_shop","provides":["server_shop"],"release":9125,"repo":"https://github.com/AntumMT/mod-server_shop","score":159.6,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/f552c2d8db.png"],"short_description":"Shops intended to be set up by server administrators.","state":"APPROVED","tags":["commerce","multiplayer"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/f552c2d8db.png","title":"Server Shops","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/AntumDeluge/server_shop/releases/9125/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"AntumDeluge/server_shop":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"wdata","packages":["AntumDeluge/wdata"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"simple_models","packages":["AntumDeluge/simple_models"]}],"AntumDeluge/simple_models":[],"AntumDeluge/wdata":[]},"hash":"13grvn9ip19kil834xpl8as43s2nwwwccjs10jn27rsbacsmj06b"}
