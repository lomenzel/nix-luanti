  "long_description": "# Dripstone\n\nThis Minetest mod adds dripstone to Minetest.\n\nThe mod exposes 4 types of dripstone, which change based on the liquids above them. Dripstone can also be used to create a lava or water farm.\n\nYou can read the [API manual](https://git.noordstar.me/Bram/dripstone/src/branch/main/API.md) for an extensive explanation on how the dripstone works in this mod. This mod is designed to be easy to mod for people who like to expand on existing mods.\n\n## Contribute\n\nYou can contribute by making pull requests or by reaching out to me [on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@bram:matrix.directory).\n\n## Licensing\n\nBy default, this work is originally copyrighted under the EUPL v1.2. If you do not wish to use the restrictions of copyleft, you can do the following:\n\n1. You may include the mod on your personal Minetest server without needing to tell me.
