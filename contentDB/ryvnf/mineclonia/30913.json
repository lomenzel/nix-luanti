  "long_description": "# Mineclonia\nAn unofficial Minecraft-like game for Minetest. Fork of MineClone 2 with focus\non stability, multiplayer performance and features. For information about migrating from\nMineClone 2 to Mineclonia, see [this document](https://codeberg.org/mineclonia/mineclonia/src/branch/main/MIGRATING.md).\n\nDiscord server: https://discord.gg/WAwpPWHTXZ\n(Only for informal communication, particularly for players. All \"official\" development happens on the bugtracker!)\n\n### Differences from MineClone 2\n* Overworld depth increased from 64 to 128 nodes\n* Improved nether portals\n* Improved leaf decay\n* Improved villages\n* Improved mobs\n* Wandering traders and trader llamas\n* Suspicious nodes, pottery shreds and decorated pots\n* Conduits\n* Candles\n* Deep dark biome and ancient hermitage (structure corresponding to ancient city)\n* Functional loom to apply banner patterns\n* Lush caves biome\n* Cherry grove biome\n* No in-game music, twice as small compared to MineClone 2\n* No hamburgers\n\n### Gameplay\nYou start in a randomly-generated world made entirely of cubes. You can explore\nthe world and dig and build almost every block in the world to create new\nstructures. You can choose to play in a “survival mode” in which you have to\nfight monsters and hunger for survival and slowly progress through the various\nother aspects of the game, such as mining, farming, building machines, and so on\nOr you can play in “creative mode” in which you can build almost anything\ninstantly.\n\n#### Gameplay summary\n* Sandbox-style gameplay, no goals\n* Survive: Fight against hostile monsters and hunger\n* Mine for ores and other treasures\n* Magic: Gain experience and enchant your tools\n* Use the collected blocks to create great buildings, your imagination is the\n  limit\n* Collect flowers (and other dye sources) and colorize your world\n* Find some seeds and start farming\n* Find or craft one of hundreds of items\n* Build a railway system and have fun with minecarts\n* Build complex machines with redstone circuits\n* In creative mode you can build almost anything for free and without limits\n\n## How to play (quick start)\n### Getting started\n* **Punch a tree** trunk until it breaks and collect wood\n* Place the **wood into the 2×2 grid** (your “crafting grid” in your inventory\n  menu and craft 4 wood planks\n* Place the 4 wood planks in a 2×2 shape in the crafting grid to **make a\n  crafting table**\n* **Rightclick the crafting table** for a 3×3 crafting grid to craft more\n  complex things\n* Use the **crafting guide** (book icon) to learn all the possible crafting\n  recipes\n* **Craft a wooden pickaxe** so you can dig stone\n* Different tools break different kinds of blocks. Try them out!\n* Continue playing as you wish. Have fun!\n\n### Farming\n* Find seeds\n* Craft hoe\n* Rightclick dirt or similar block with hoe to create farmland\n* Place seeds on farmland and watch them grow\n* Collect plant when fully grown\n* If near water, farmland becomes wet and speeds up growth\n\n### Furnace\n* Craft furnace\n* Furnace allows you to obtain more items\n* Upper slot must contain a smeltable item (example: iron ore)\n* Lower slot must contain a fuel item (example: coal)\n* See tooltips in crafting guide to learn about fuels and smeltable items\n\n### Additional help\nMore help about the gameplay, blocks items and much more can be found from\ninside the game. You can access the help from your inventory menu.\n\n### Special items\nThe following items are interesting for Creative Mode and for adventure\nmap builders. They can not be obtained in-game or in the creative inventory.\n\n* Barrier: `mcl_core:barrier`\n\nUse the `/giveme` chat command to obtain them. See the in-game help for\nan explanation.\n\n## Installation\nThis game requires [Minetest](http://minetest.net) to run (version 5.9 or\nlater). So you need to install Minetest first. Only stable versions of Minetest\nare officially supported. There is no support for running Mineclonia in\ndevelopment versions of Minetest.\n\nTo install Mineclonia (if you haven't already), move this directory into the\n“games” directory of your Minetest data directory. Consult the help of\nMinetest to learn more.\n\n## Project description\nThe main goal of **Mineclonia** is to be a stable and performant clone of\nMinecraft released as free software.\n\n* Minecraft is aimed to be cloned as well as Minetest currently permits without\n  resorting to hacks which are too heavyweight or complicated to maintain\n* Cloning the gameplay has highest priority\n* Cloning the interface has low priority. It will only be roughly imitated\n* Mineclonia will use different graphics and sounds, but with a similar style\n\n## Completion status\nThis game is currently in **beta** stage.\nIt is playable, but not yet feature-complete.\nBackwards-compatibility is not guaranteed, updating your world might cause bugs\nand things to behave differently.\n\nThe following main features are available:\n\n* Tools, weapons\n* Armor\n* Crafting system: 2×2 grid, crafting table (3×3 grid), furnace, including a\n  crafting guide\n* Chests, large chests, ender chests, shulker boxes\n* Furnaces, hoppers\n* Hunger\n* Most monsters and animals\n* All ores from Minecraft\n* Most blocks in the overworld\n* Water and lava\n* Weather\n* 28 biomes + 5 Nether Biomes\n* The Nether, a fiery underworld in another dimension\n* Redstone circuits (partially)\n* Minecarts (partial)\n* Status effects (partial)\n* Experience\n* Enchanting\n* Brewing, potions, tipped arrow (partial)\n* Boats\n* Fire\n* Buidling blocks: Stairs, slabs, doors, trapdoors, fences, fence gates, walls\n* Clock\n* Compass\n* Sponge\n* Slime block\n* Small plants and saplings\n* Dyes\n* Banners\n* Deco blocks: Glass, stained glass, glass panes, iron bars, hardened clay (and\n  colors), heads and more\n* Item frames\n* Jukeboxes\n* Beds\n* Inventory menu\n* Creative inventory\n* Farming\n* Writable books\n* Commands\n* Villages\n* The End\n* And more!\n\nThe following features are incomplete and might change in the future:\n\n* Some monsters and animals\n* Redstone-related things\n* Special minecarts\n* A couple of non-trivial blocks and items\n\nBonus features (not found in Minecraft):\n\n* Built-in crafting guide which shows you crafting and smelting recipes\n* In-game help system containing extensive help about gameplay basics, blocks,\n  items and more\n* Fully moddable (thanks to Minetest's powerful Lua API)\n* Bookshelves can be used to store books\n* Nether portals can be created with custom shapes\n* New blocks and items:\n    * Lookup tool, shows you the help for whatever it touches\n    * More slabs and stairs\n    * Nether Brick Fence Gate\n    * Red Nether Brick Fence\n    * Red Nether Brick Fence Gate\n\nTechnical differences from Minecraft:\n\n* Height limit of ca. 31000 blocks (much higher than in Minecraft)\n* Horizontal world size is ca. 62000×62000 blocks (much smaller than in\n  Minecraft, but it is still very large)\n* Still incomplete and buggy\n* Blocks, items, enemies and other features are missing\n* Structure replacements - these small variants of Minecraft structures serve as\n  replacements until we can get large structures working:\n    * Woodland Cabin (Mansions)\n    * Nether Outpost (Fortress)\n    * Ocean Temple (Monument)\n    * Nether Bulwark (Bastion)\n    * End Shipwreck & End Boat (End city)\n* A few items have slightly different names to make them easier to distinguish\n* Different music for jukebox\n* Different textures (Pixel Perfection)\n* Different sounds (various sources)\n* Different engine (Minetest)\n* Different easter eggs\n\n… and finally, Mineclonia is free software (“free” as in “freedom”)!",
