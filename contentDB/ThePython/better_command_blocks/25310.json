  "long_description": "# Better Command Blocks\nAdds command blocks similar to those of a certain other voxel game (hereafter referred to as ACOVG). It is the only command block mod to support my [Better Commands](https://github.com/thepython10110/better_commands) mod. It includes impulse, repeating, and chain command blocks, and *should* be game-agnostic (although you kind of need Mesecons/redstone for impulse command blocks to be useful).\n\nTo use the command blocks, you must have the `better_command_blocks` priv.\n\n## License:\n* Code: Licensed under MIT\n* Textures: Created by me, inspired by ACOVG's (and various ACOVG texture packs that I considered using instead), and licensed under CC-BY-SA-4.0",
