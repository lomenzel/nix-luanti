  "long_description": "This mod lights up your environment as long as you are wielding a light emitting item (either normal wield or in mineclonia's offhand slot).\n\nThis works in the same way as https://content.luanti.org/packages/bell07/wielded_light/ (by placing invisible light nodes) but supports mcl_offhand and is a lot more compact (less than 100 lines of code).\n\nBut due to the fact that it works by frequently placing and removing nodes it is not recommended to be used on servers. And also it only works if the player's head is in air.\n\nMineClone2/5 might (probably do at this point) work but are not officially supported.",
