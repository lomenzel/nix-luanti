  "long_description": "\n# Bonified\nAdds some features related to the bones you get from dead players in MTG.\n\nAlso changes the appearance of the bones block to a pile of bones with a proper 3D model.\n\n\n## Bones, Bone Meal, & Fertilizer\nBones are a new item you can obtain from bone piles, randomly from various kinds of soil, and from a few other sources listed in later sections.\n\nIf not disabled in the mod's settings, you can make bones into **Bone Meal**, which speeds up the growth of crops and saplings, and can be further made into fertilizer which has an even greater effect.\n\nBones can also be made back into bone piles, and into bone blocks, which are decorative and a crafting ingredient.\n\n## Bone Tools & Armor\nBone tools are made from bone blocks, and are comparable to bronze tools in terms of capabilities. However, as their durability goes down they gradually start to dig faster and deal more damage up to a limit of 2x at 0 durability.\n\nBone armor is simply normal armor similar in defense to bronze armor. The 3d_armor mod is required for bone armor to be available.\n\n## Fossils\nAncient Fossils can be obtained from fossil ore, which spawns in stone and permafrost. Fossil ores also drop bones.\n\nFossil tools are crafted with ancient fossils and use bones instead of sticks, and are equivalent to mese tools but with more durability.\nFossil armor sits between steel and diamond, and is made with Ancient Fossils and bronze ingots.\n\nAncient Fossils can also be made into fossil meal, which is similar to bone meal and fertilizer and has the highest effect of the three.\n\n## Dungeon Loot\n\nVarious items from Bonified can be found in loot chests in dungeons, including bones, bonemeal, fossils, and tools and armor.\n\n## Decorative Nodes\n\nBone blocks and fossil blocks can both be made into bricks, which can be made into slabs, stairs, and walls.\n\n## Licensing\n\nThe source code and data files of Bonified are licensed under Apache 2.0. See LICENSE.txt.\n\nThe media files of Bonified are licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0. See MEDIA_LICENSE.txt\n",
