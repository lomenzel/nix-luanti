  "long_description": "Artifact is a simple adventure game created for the 2024 Minetest (Luanti) game jam.\n\nThe player takes the part of an adventurer named Key, who is on a mission to find and destroy a rumored source of evil at the bottom of a cave. Little does he understand the forces and factors at play.\n\nBecause Artifact was made in 3 weeks and I let several days get away from me, puzzles are minimal and the latter cutscenes have very poor quality, for which I apologize in advance.\n",
