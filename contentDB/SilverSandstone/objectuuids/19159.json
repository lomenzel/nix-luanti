Entities will lose their UUIDs, but not their data.\n\n\nAPI Summary\n-----------\n\n- `objectuuids.get_uuid(object)`                                    - Returns the UUID assigned to the specified object.\n- `objectuuids.get_object_by_uuid(uuid)`                            - Returns the object with the specified UUID.\n- `objectuuids.set_uuid(object, uuid)`                              - Overrides the specified object's UUID.\n- `objectuuids.add_entity_with_uuid(pos, name, uuid, [staticdata])` - Spawns a new entity with the specified UUID.\n\nSee `doc/index.html` for full API documentation.","maintainers":["SilverSandstone"],"media_license":"MIT","name":"objectuuids","provides":["objectuuids"],"release":19159,"repo":null,"score":4.9,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/8155dc6dcf.png"],"short_description":"Assigns a persistent UUID to every object.","state":"APPROVED","tags":["library"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/8155dc6dcf.png","title":"Object UUIDs","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/SilverSandstone/objectuuids/releases/19159/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"SilverSandstone/objectuuids":[]},"hash":"0y08r85fw4rlmlyiq0bbygdwmxbxzpmnp55vn779d94n9164yxvh"}
