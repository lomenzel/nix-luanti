  "long_description": "# worldedit_bigschems\n\nworldedit_bigschems is a mod that extends the functionality of the WorldEdit mod by adding four new commands. These commands allow users to create and place large schematics, as well as maintain a command journal for undoing past actions.\n\nThey were used as part of the [UNEJ project](https://minetest.net/education/), which uses Minetest with students to rework on real areas in France. This was made possible thanks to the [IGN (French  National Institute of Geographic and Forest Information) service](https://minecraft.ign.fr/), which allows to create Minetest maps from from geographical data of France or the world (OSM data).\n\n**Requirements**: WorldEdit mod must be installed.\n\n## Commands\n\n### `//bigmtschemcreate \\<folder_name\\>`\n\nThis command creates a folder within the schematics directory of the WorldEdit area (which must already be set up).  \nIt functions the same as the `//mtschemcreate` command from WorldEdit, but with the ability to create large schematics.\n\n---\n\n### `//bigmtschemplace \\<folder_name\\>`\n\nThis command imports a schematic created by the `//bigmtschemcreate` command.  \nThe import starts from the `pos1` position in WorldEdit, which will serve as the bottom-left corner of the schematic.  \nIt is similar to the `//mtschemplace` command, but allows for placing large schematics.\n\n---\n\n### `//worldjournal`\n\nDisplays a list of logged actions that can be undone.\n\n---\n\n### `//worldundo [ID]`\n\nUndoes the actions from `//bigmtschemplace` command.  \nThe ID corresponds to the log ID shown by the `//worldjournal` command. ID `1` represents the most recent action.\n\n---\n\n## License\n\nLicensed under the AGPL (Affero General Public License).\n\n## Funding\n\nThis mod is published with [funding from the NLNet Foundation](https://nlnet.nl/project/MinetestEdu/).\n",
