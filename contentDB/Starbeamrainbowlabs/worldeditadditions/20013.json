  "long_description": "# WorldEditAdditions\n> Extra tools and commands to extend WorldEdit for Minetest\n\nIf you can dream of it, it probably belongs here!\n\nWorldEditAdditions adds commands for everything from generating instant forests to advanced geometry to smoothing terrain, and that's barely starting to scratch the surface!\n\n**Important News: The `master` branch has been renamed to `main`, to follow the new standard across the Git ecosystem. If you've installed _WorldEditAdditions_ through git, you will need to re-clone the repository.**\n\n**Official Discord Server:** <https://discord.gg/y8VT6HTQr7>\n\n## Quick Reference\nClick a command name to view a detailed explanation of how it works. Particularly with some of the more complex commands (e.g. `//erode`) the detailed explanation has a discussion on how it works and reference tables of supported parameters.\n\n### Geometry\n - [`//ellipsoid <rx> <ry> <rz> <node_name>`](https://github.com/sbrl/Minetest-WorldEditAdditions/blob/main/Chat-Command-Reference.md#ellipsoid-rx-ry-rz-node_name)\n -

Install it and then try launching Minetest (or the `minetest-server`) again.\n\n### I get an error saying that `worldedit.register_command()` is not a function\nThis is probably because your version of `worldedit` is too old. Try updating it. Specifically the `worldedit.register_command()` function was only added to `worldedit` in December 2019.\n\n### I get a crash on  startup saying `attempt to call field 'alias_command' (a nil value)`\nPlease update to v1.8+. There was a bug in earlier versions that caused a race condition that sometimes resulted in this crash.\n\n### Why don't the [moretrees](https://content.minetest.net/packages/VanessaE/moretrees/) trees work with `//forest`?\nAs far as I can tell, the saplings provided by the [`moretrees` mod](https://content.minetest.net/packages/VanessaE/moretrees/) don't properly interact with bonemeal from the [bonemeal mod](https://content.minetest.net/packages/TenPlus1/bonemeal/), which WorldEditAdditions uses to grow trees. WorldEditAdditions has everything in place needed to support them, but until applying bonemeal to `moretrees` saplings results in a tree rather than waiting for one to grow over time, WorldEditAdditions will always fail to place trees provided by the `moretrees` mod, unfortunately.\n\n## Contributing\nContributions are welcome! Please state in your pull request(s) that you release your contribution under the _Mozilla Public License 2.0_.\n\nPlease also make sure that the logic for every new command has it's own file. For example, the logic for `//floodfill` goes in `worldeditadditions/lib/floodfill.lua`, the logic for `//overlay` goes in `worldeditadditions/lib/overlay.lua`, etc.\n\nWant to say hi or leave feedback?
