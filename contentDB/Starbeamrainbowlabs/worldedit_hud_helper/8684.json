  "long_description": "# WorldEdit HUD Helper [worldedit_hud_helper]\n\n> A helpful HUD that shows the name of the node you're pointing at and the direction you're pointing in.\n> Makes using WorldEdit (and [WorldEditAdditions](https://worldeditadditions.mooncarrot.space/)!) that little bit easier :-)\n\nDespite the name, it doesn't actually depend on `worldedit` at all!\n\n\n## Usage\nAfter installing the mod and restarting your server, you should see it appear automagically above your hotbar.\n\nTo toggle its display, use the `//hud` command - it takes no arguments.\n\n## Chat Commands\nworldedit_hud_helper provides 2 chat commands:\n\n### `//hud`\nToggles whether the HUD is shown or not.\n\n\n### `//hudoffset <offset_in_pixels>`\nAdjusts the vertical height of the HUD. For example, to adjust it to be greater (higher up on the screen), do this:\n\n```\n//hudoffset 50\n```\n\nThe default value is 0. You can reset to the default value like this:\n\n```\n//hudoffset\n```\n\n\n## Changelog\n - v0.1: 14th September 2018\n\t - Initial release.\n - v0.2: 16th September 2018\n     - Fix undeclared global variable access.\n - v0.3: 2nd May 2020\n     - Fix potential bug in raycast\n     - Ignore `wielded_light:*` nodes when raycasting\n - v0.4: 31st May 2021\n     - Fix deprecation warning for `getpos` â†’ `get_pos` (#2)\n - v0.5: 31st July 2021\n     - Add `//hudoffset [<offset_in_pixels>]` chat command to adjust the vertical offset of the HUD (fixes #1)\n     - Persist per-player settings to disk (per-world)\n\n\n## License\nThis mod is licensed under the _Mozilla Public License 2.0_, a copy of which (along with a helpful summary as to what you can and can't do with it) can be found in the [`LICENSE`](https://gitlab.com/sbrl/worldedit_hud_helper/blob/master/LICENSE) file in this repository.\n\nIf you'd like to do something that the license prohibits, please get in touch as it's possible we can negotiate something.\n",
