  "long_description": "**Please note: this is a multiplayer-only game. You can run it on a local server or play on an online server**\n\nYou can make your own arenas now. Use: https://content.minetest.net/packages/MisterE/blockbomber_editor/\nArenas are distributed as mods. Once you have made arenas, contact me to include them on my server and maybe in the main Blockbomber game release.\n\n\nMade by: threehymns and MisterE\n# **Controls** \nMove with your arrow keys.\n\nDrop a bomb with Sneak (Shift).\n\nThrow a bomb that you are standing in with space (if you have \"spring\").\n\nPunch a bomb with LMB (if you have \"fist\").\n\n# **Goal** \n\nThe goal is to be the last player standing. Accomplish that by collecting the good items to increase your abilities, avoiding the bad ones, placing bombs strategically at the right place at the right time, and not falling.\n\nBTW, falling is based on center, not on hitbox. Watch out! \nYou can move through other players, but you cannot move through bombs.\n\n# **Powerups**\n**GOOD**\n\nstackable:\nBomb: the more bombs you have, the more you can place at once!\nTnt: The more tnts you have, the larger your bombs' blasts will be!\nShoes: You start out a bit slow. Get shoes to get faster, but take care you dont get too fast and fall off!\n\nPermanent:\n\nSpring: allows you to throw bombs that you have just placed or are standing in with the jump key\nFist: Allows you to punch bombs that you are standing next to (but not *in*)\n\nTemporary:\nCompass: Makes your explosions go in diagonal directions as well as orthagonal.\nHeart: Gives you one extra life, against bomb blasts only! One at a time!\n\nOther:\nPheonix: Ressurects any players who have died already.\n\n**Bad** (Maluses)\n\n*all bad powerups are temporary and can be removed by getting another powerup or waiting for them to expire\n\nConfused Frog: Switches your direction when you try to move\nSnail: Makes you super slow\nCoffee: Makes you *too* fast\nX-bomb: You cant place bombs til its gone!\nParty: Bomb fest!\n\n\n\n# **Floor Blocks:**\nFloor: a regular block you can stand on\nIce: a block where it is hard to change velocity\nArrow: Pushes bombs in that direction\nMortar: throws bombs to a random location on the board\nAir: You can fall thru holes if you're not careful!\n\n# **Wall blocks**\nCrate: always drops an item when blasted\nBrick: is removable with a blast; has a chance to drop an item\nWall: can never be broken; an imovable wall\n",
