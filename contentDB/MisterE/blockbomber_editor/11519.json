  "long_description": "How to make your own Blockbomber arenas\n============================================\n\n1) Download this game\n2) Make a new world, enter it. in creative with damage disabled. Note the world name.\nThe red corner is the origin.\n\n![a new world](2.png)\n\n3) Build you arena. \nFloor nodes can only be placed on the floor, other nodes can only be placed above it.\nSet worldedit position 1 at the origin by standing on it and sending the command: \n\n`//1`\n\nset position 2 such that it contains the arena.\n`//2`\n\n![arena made](4.png)\n\n4) Save your arena with: \n\n`//mtschemcreate <arena_file_name>` <-- replace everything in brackets and the brackets themselves with the filename of the arena\n\n\n5) get a pen and paper\n\n6) move to each spawn position, and set position 1 there\n`//1` \nThat will send you the location of the spawn in chat. Write it down\n\n![spawn recording](5.png)\n\n7) move to the spectator position. Set position 1 there and write down the spectator position.\n\nThe spectator position should be above and in the center of the arena.\n\n![spectator recording](6.png)\n\n8) now, open the game files. You will find a sample mod inside the folder `<minetest_folder>/games/blockbomber_editor/sample_arena_mod`\n\nRename the `my_arenas` mod to whatever you want to name your arenas expansion pack as.\n\nedit mod.conf inside the mod to change the name\n\n9) navigate you your worlds folder. Find the world that you made for the editor. open the schems folder inside.\n\n`<minetest_folder>/worlds/<yourworld>/schems`\n\ncopy the schematic that you made\n\npaste it in the schems folder of your mod\n\n`<minetest_folder>/games/blockbomber_editor/<sample_arena_mod>/schems`\n\n10) open the init.lua file in the sample mod\n\nit looks like this:\n\n```lua\n\nlocal modpath = minetest.get_modpath(\"my_arenas\")\nlocal schemdir = modpath..\"/schems/\"\n\n\n\n\nbb_schems.register_arena({\n    \n    name = \"My Special Arena\", --the human readable name of the arenas\n    author = \"YourName\", --the author of the arenas\n    schem = schemdir..\"myarena.mts\", --the replace with the name of the schematic\n    min = 2, --minimum players\n    max = 4, --maximum players\n    spawns = {\n        vector.new(x,y,z), -- the spawn locations, needs as many as max players\n        \n    }, --a table of spawn locations\n    spectator_pos = vector.new(x,y,z), -- spectator position, should be above and in the center of the arena.\n})\n```\n\n11) Replace the information according to your needs.\n\n* modpath\n    at the top of the file change the mod name inside get_modpath\n\n\n* name \n* author\n* schem\n    replace the name.mts part with the name of the file\n* min and max players\n* spawns \n    You need as many spawns as max players. You should have these written down.\n    replace x,y,and z and copy the `vector.new` line over as many times as you need to define all your spawns\n* spectator_pos \n    enter the spectator position you wrote down\n\n12) you can add as many arenas to your mod as you like.\nwhen finished, release your arena expansion pack mod on the forums and/or github and/or Contentdb and then ping MisterE to update Blockbomber with your mod :D\n\n\n",
