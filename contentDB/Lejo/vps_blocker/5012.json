These clients will be blocked  \nIt gets the information from proxy-check websites like iphub.info\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nFirst you need to add vps_blocker to secure.http_mods to allow http requests.\n\nSet the kick message:  \nvps_kick_message = \"You are using a proxy, vpn or other hosting services, please disable them to play on this server.\"\n\nCommands\n--------\n\nUse /vps_wl (add or remove) (name) to allow people using vps.\n\nCheckers\n--------\n\nPaste the keys to the minetest.conf\n\n###### iphub.info\n\nTo use iphub.info you need to register there(recommend)  \nYou get 1000 requests/day for free  \niphub_key = 123\n\n###### getipintel.net\n\nYou must set an own contact email for getipintel.net  \nPlease first go to the webpage and read what it's used for!  \ngetipintel_contact = example@example.com\n\n###### proxycheck.io\n\nFor a higher request limit 1000 instead of 100 requests and dashboard register at there webpage\nproxycheck_key = 1-2-3-4\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThe idea for the mod is taken from https://github.com/red-001/block_vps but it's a complete redo of it.\n\nCreated by [Lejo](https://github.com/Lejo1)\nLicense: MIT\n",
