You want to change the probability of the leaf nodes to be something less than 254 to make the leaf placement be a little more random and thus more natural looking.  To accomplish that do the following.\n1) Create a world in minetest and enable schmedit and lua2mts mods in that world.\n2) In a file manager create a schems sub folder in that world folder.  e.g.  C:\\games\\minetest-5.7.0-win64\\worlds\\myworld\\schems\n3) Copy all the tree .mts files into that schems folder\n4) Use the command \"/mts2lua tree_1\" for all of the tree files 1-9.  To convert them all to .lua files. \n5) Open tree .lua files in a text editor.  \n6) Search and replace \"{name=\"default:tree_leaves\", prob=254, param2=0},\" with \"{name=\"default:tree_leaves\", prob=190, param2=0},\" \n7) Use the command \"/lua2mts tree_1\"  for all of the .lua files 1-9.  This will convert them all back to .mts files. \n\n## Usage help\nThis mod assumes you already have a basic understanding about how schematics in Minetest work.\nIf not, refer to the Minetest Lua API documentation to understand more about schematics.","maintainers":["Neuromancer"],"media_license":"MIT","name":"lua2mts","provides":["lua2mts"],"release":25502,"repo":"https://github.com/Neuromancer56/lua2mts","score":155,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/fe4575bf2a.png"],"short_description":"Allows converting .lua schematics files to .mts files.","state":"APPROVED","tags":["chat","developer_tools","mapgen"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/fe4575bf2a.png","title":"Lua2Mts","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/Neuromancer/lua2mts/releases/25502/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":"https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=29622","dependencies":{"Neuromancer/lua2mts":[]},"hash":"1m8qcdmdfchsm40jx9jmk8jljnkrkcpbi9mmz9fk31gv29yk60qm"}
