  "long_description": "Pass in a node name and a function, and every time a player touches that node, your custom function executes. This mod is heavilly based on the cactus_damage mod by VMan_2002\n\n## Example:\nWhen adding gameplay, one thing that comes in handy is performing an action when a player touches a node.  For example making a player take hitpoint damage when touching a cactus.\nIn my Hero Mines game I needed a light to break when a player touched it, and for the player to take damage when touching magma nodes. You can see the magma example below.\n\n## Usage:\nAdd the node_touch_action to the depends statement in your mod.conf file:\n\n```\ndepends = default, node_touch_action\n```\n\nAfter you register your node create a function to be executed when the node is touched:\n\n```lua\nlocal function magmaTouchAction(player)\n    player:set_hp(player:get_hp() - 1, \"magma\")\nend\n```\n\nThen Register the action to occur when node is touched.  The first parameter is the node name, the second parameter is the function that happens when the node is touched.\n\n```lua\nregisterNodeTouchAction(\"hero_mines:magma\", magmaTouchAction)\n```\n",
