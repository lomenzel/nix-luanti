  "long_description": "# Occupy Moon\n\nBuild a base on the moon. You will find ores, but will you be able to produce organics?\n\n![Greenhouse](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlars/mt_occupy_moon_game/main/screenshot_2.png?raw=true \"A greenhouse on the moon\")\n\n## Warning\nDevelopment is far from finished, but you should be able to have a good time for a few hours!\n## Updates 0.2 -> 0.3\nSo many small changes, thanks to the comments of the 2022 GameJam participants!\n\n- Auto-equip spacesuit at the start of the game\n- Spacesuit can be refilled by holding an air bottle in your hand and use it\n- This means you don´t need an inventory mod as long as your spacesuit doesn´t break.\n- Moon gravity fixed\n- Supply rocket accesible via door, contains air!\n- ChemSampler shows the items needed for the next mission\n- Cleaned up mods folders, renamed moonrealm nodes and items to omg_moonrealm. Automatically replace some items in the world and in chests. If I missed something, please let me know or have the items in the inventory when re-joining a server.\n- Spawn more ores for technic.\n- Probably more, I don´t really remember...\n\n## Updates 0.3 -> 0.4\n- Added rocket animation, rocket only 'lands' when there is space.\n- Added some ingame information for the player on how to survive on the moon. Find it in your inventory.\n\n## Plans for 0.5\n- Energy: using only lv solar arrays is hard.\n- Somehow generate sulfur, granite, marble, desert stone in worldgen or find suitable recipe replacements.\n\n## How to play\nBefore starting a world, enable your favorite inventory with 3d_armor support! Only then you can wear your spacesuit!\n### Get started\nYou start with a landing site marker for a supply rocket.\nPlace it on a free spot, step back and wait for max. 30 seconds for the rocket to arrive.\nApart from other things, you will find a **Chemicals Sampler** which you will need to unlock more supplies.\nYour task is to show that you can produce food and resources on the moon!\n\n- Build a sealed greenhouse.\n- Release the air inside.\n- Get some moon stone, turn it into gravel.\n- Get some moon dust and take some wheat from your supplies.\n- Make soil from these three ingredients! Don´t place it outside, though...\n- Find some ice as water source.\n- Plant your first crops!\n\n### Another word of warning\nYou better don´t extend your greenhouse from within, build a second or a third one. The vacuum mod might ruin you otherwise...\n![Dried shrubs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlars/mt_occupy_moon_game/main/screenshot_1.png?raw=true \"Don´t touch the vacuum\")\n\n### Get more supplies\nThose guys on earth want you to first provide **12 wheat**. Stuff it into the Chemicals Sampler and expect some supplies in exchange.\nNext, is to show that you can expand. Insert **20 dirt** and **2 white wool** for the next supplies.\n\n## Mods\n### Existing mods used\n\n- 3d_armor\n- basic_materials\n- default\n- dye\n- farming\n- flowers\n- moonrealm (a modified version called omg_moonrealm)\n- pipeworks\n- player_api\n- player_monoids\n- scifi_nodes\n- screwdriver\n- spacesuit\n- stairs\n- technic\n- vacuum\n- vessels\n- wool\n\n### Mods created for this game\n- omg_missions: some basic missions and rewards\n- omg_world: moon gravity, ore generation, start inventory",
