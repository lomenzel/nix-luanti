Train stations are connected to each other with rails going through tunnels.\n\nTrains randomly appear in the antiquorum chests deep underground.\n\nThis is a work in progress, potential improvements:\n\n* currently it uses the default rails from AdvTrains but may use custom rails for Exile in the future.\n* currently it uses advtrains_train_japan but may use custom trains for Exile in the future.\n* this mod may include additional features, such as having spacecraft that launch from tubes with magnetic linear motors, which might allow exiles to return to where they were exiled from...","maintainers":["programmerjake"],"media_license":"LGPL-3.0-or-later","name":"exile_rails","provides":["exile_rails"],"release":29736,"repo":"https://codeberg.org/programmerjake/exile-rails","score":2,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/1777aa5c0e.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/18b14a54d1.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/0281460cf6.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/d6c00cc6df.png"],"short_description":"Adding underground rails and trains to Exile","state":"APPROVED","tags":["mapgen","transport"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/1777aa5c0e.png","title":"Exile Rails","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/programmerjake/exile_rails/releases/29736/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":"https://codeberg.org/programmerjake/exile-rails","dependencies":{"orwell/advtrains":[],"orwell/basic_trains":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"advtrains_train_track","packages":["orwell/advtrains"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"advtrains","packages":["orwell/advtrains"]}],"programmerjake/exile_rails":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"advtrains_train_track","packages":["orwell/advtrains"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"exile_env_sounds","packages":["Mantar/exile"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"advtrains","packages":["orwell/advtrains"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"advtrains_train_japan","packages":["orwell/basic_trains"]}]},"hash":"0qwl8r9ri13lndczxi4jcc52g1bnljzkafnybk51nly9g7avna6y"}
