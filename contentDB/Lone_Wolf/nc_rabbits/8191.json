  "long_description": "## A short guide on how to get some tasty cooked rabbit\n* Search around grassy areas near sea level to find rabbit holes.\n* Once you find one construct a trap over it with a frame and a block of loose cobble.\n* Wait 6-7 minutes for the rabbit to trap itself. If you're lucky you will have caught a rabbit, if you're unlucky you'll just have to try again\n* If you were lucky then you now have a dead rabbit on your hands. To cook it light a fire and place the rabbit next to a flame\n* Once it has cooked make sure to grab it before it's overcooked into an ash lump\n* Enjoy your food you murderer",
