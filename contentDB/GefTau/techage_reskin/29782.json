The aim is to be more visually appealing and fit in with Minetest Game's native resolution.\n\nNote that while the pack itself is active, you cannot use other texture packs, even though this can make sense to do. However, you can copy the textures from multiple packs into one folder and have both packs active that way.","maintainers":["GefTau"],"media_license":"CC-BY-SA-4.0","name":"techage_reskin","provides":[],"release":29782,"repo":"https://github.com/GefullteTaubenbrust2/TechageReskin.git","score":512.8,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/b86416aca2.png"],"short_description":"Applies to the Techage Modpack, changing most of its textures to 16px and a different visual style.","state":"APPROVED","tags":["16px"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/b86416aca2.png","title":"Techage Reskin","translation_url":null,"type":"txp","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/GefTau/techage_reskin/releases/29782/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":"https://github.com/GefullteTaubenbrust2/TechageReskin/tree/main","dependencies":{"GefTau/techage_reskin":[]},"hash":"13f6z814x6drmffzxmfhm9x0wmx682skfyw2vvrrjxrab8vx0ml9"}
