  "long_description": "**Overview :**\n\nPerformance issues are a common challenge in Minetest, especially on servers or worlds where items are frequently dropped and left on the ground. These ground entities can accumulate over time and significantly affect game performance, causing noticeable lag.\n\nClearLag is a lightweight and configurable mod designed to automatically remove ground items at a defined interval. This helps to maintain smoother gameplay and reduce unnecessary load on the server or local system.\n\n**Key Features**\n\n* Automatic item cleanup: Clears all dropped ground items on a timer.\n* Customizable interval: Define how often the cleanup occurs using a simple command.\n* Toggle functionality: Enable or disable the system at any time.\n* Non-intrusive: Only affects dropped itemsâ€”no mobs, players, or other entities are impacted.\n* Ideal for singleplayer and servers: Especially useful in survival worlds, creative builds, and community servers.\n\n**Commands**\n\n/cltime <milliseconds>\nSet the interval (in milliseconds) between each ground item cleanup.\n\n/cltime help\nDisplays command usage instructions and syntax.\n\n/cl on\nEnables the automatic cleanup system.\n\n/cl off\nDisables the cleanup process.",
