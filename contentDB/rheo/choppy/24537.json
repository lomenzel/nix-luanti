  "long_description": "# choppy\n\nyet another tree-cutting mod\n\n## differences from other tree-cutting mods\n\n* no lag\n* cuts from the top down\n* recognizes specific species of tree (new trees must be registered)\n* recognizes tree boundaries (very approximate, but can be extended)\n* axes must be whitelisted (commonly known axe names are whitelisted by default)\n* respects protection\n* can be \"on by default\"\n* will automatically stop before breaking your axe\n* digs nodes in proportion to the axe's true speed, and will \"catch up\" if there's lag.\n* differentiates player-built and natural trees when possible (NOTE: this only applies to structures built after this mod is installed)\n\n### commands\n\n* `/toggle_choppy`\n\n  toggles whether you have to hold down \"sneak\" to enable choppy, or whether it will be enabled by default.\n\n### settings\n\nsee [settingtypes.txt]\n\n### public api\n\n* `choppy.api.register_axe(itemstring)`\n\n  register a tool that will work as an axe\n\n* `choppy.api.unregister_axe(itemstring)`\n\n  unregister a tool that will work as an axe\n\n* `choppy.api.is_enabled(player)`\n\n  returns \"true\" if choppy mode is enabled for a player. this means that existing processes will continue,\n  and new processes can be started.\n\n* `choppy.api.toggle_enabled(player_name)`\n\n  toggles whether the player has to hold down \"sneak\" to enable choppy, or whether it will be enabled by default.\n\n* `choppy.api.register_on_choppy_start(function(process, player, start_pos, tree_node))`\n\n  called when a choppy process is started. return \"true\" to abort the process.\n\n* `choppy.api.register_on_choppy_stop(function(player_name))`\n\n  called when a choppy process is stopped.\n\n* `choppy.api.register_on_before_chop(function(process, player, pos, node))`\n\n  called before chopping a node. return \"true\" to skip the node.\n\n* `choppy.api.register_tree_shape(shape_name, def)`\n\n  register a tree \"shape\", which allows limited ways of preventing multiple trees from being felled simultaneously.\n  def includes two callbacks:\n\n  * `in_bounds = function(pos, start_pos, shape)`\n\n    called for each node which may be chopped.\n\n  * `player_in_bounds = function(player_pos, start_pos, shape)`\n\n    called to check whether the player has wandered away from the tree\n\n* `choppy.api.register_tree(tree_name, def)`\n\n  register a tree. def defines a shape and a map of nodes to their type (trunk, leaves, etc.)\n\n* `choppy.api.unregister_tree(tree_name)`\n\n  removes a tree from the registry\n",
