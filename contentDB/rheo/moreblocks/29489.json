  "long_description": "This is a fork of the [version](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Calinou/moreblocks/) maintained by the minetest-mods group. It provides numerous new features and bugfixes and is designed to reduce the number of registered nodes, to avoid\nthe node ID limit.\n\n# mods in the pack\n\n## moreblocks\n\ndefines a bunch of new kinds of nodes. provides an API for creating variants of some nodes.\n\n## moreblocks_legacy_recipes\n\nprovided to keep compatibility w/ recipe changes from older versions of moreblocks. disabled by default.\n\n## stairsplus\n\nallows the creation of 49 new shapes for registered nodes. provides an API for registering new shapes.\n\n## stairsplus_legacy\n\nstairsplus registrations for various mods which were formerly done automatically as part of moreblocks.\n\n## stairs\n\noverrides the stairs mod from minetest_game to use stairsplus behind the scenes, to avoid duplication of nodes.\n\n## invsaw\n\nadds a button in unified_inventory that allows you to use the circular saw interface if you are\nplaying creatively, or have a circular saw item in your inventory and have the right priv\n(`interact`, by default).\n\ninvsaw was taken from [cheapie's invsaw mod](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=14736), which\nitself borrowed heavily from an older version of this mod. Flux decided to just add it here because it\nneeded to be fully rewritten to be compatible w/ their modifications to the stairsplus API.\n\n# documentation\n\n## for players\n\nuse of a decent inventory manager (e.g.\n[unified_inventory](https://content.minetest.net/packages/RealBadAngel/unified_inventory/) or\n[i3](https://content.minetest.net/packages/jp/i3/)) will help you figure out how to craft various nodes.\n\n## for admins\n\n### minetest version compatibility\n\nmore blocks is only tested against up-to-date minetest. Issues arising in older versions will generally not be fixed.\n\n### legacy mode\n\nthe 2023-02-01 release of moreblocks introduces a \"legacy\" mode, which is on by default, and is meant to\nallow new servers to not commit to creating as many nodes as older versions, while not breaking anything\non existing servers. See `settingtypes.txt` for available settings.\n\nby defaul the 2023-02-01 release disables certain recipe overrides that were part of moreblocks 2.*. to re-enable\nthem, set `moreblocks_legacy_recipes.enabled = true`.\n\n### settings\n\nsee `settingtypes.txt` for available settings.\n\n### dependencies\n\nmoreblocks and stairsplus do not have hard dependencies on other mods. invsaw depends on `unified_inventory`\nand stairsplus.\n\n### compatability\n\nmoreblocks currently supports resources from a number of mods and minetest_game. without these installed,\nsome things may not be craftable, may have low-quality textures, or may not have \"node sounds\" registered.\nif available, resources will be used from `bucket`, `default`, `rhotator`, `screwdriver`, and `vessels`.\n\nif the `stairsplus_legacy` mod is enabled, stairsplus nodes will automatically be registered for the following\nmods, if they are available: `basic_materials`, `default`, `farming`, `gloopblocks`, `prefab`, `technic`,\nand `wool`.\n\n## for mod makers\n\nSee moreblocks/API.md and stairsplus/API.md.\n\n# license\n\n## moreblocks, stairsplus, stairsplus_legacy, moreblocks_legacy_recipes\n\n* © 2011-2022 Hugo Locurcio and contributors under the zlib license\n* © 2023 fluxionary under the LGPL v3+\n\n- unless otherwise specified, textures are licensed under\n  [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\n- `moreblocks_copperpatina.png` was created by pithydon, and is licensed under\n  [CC0 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n- `stairsplus_saw_button.png` CC BY-SA 4.0 Unported\n\n## invsaw\n\n* © 2022 cheapie and contributors under the zlib license\n* © 2023 fluxionary under the LGPL v3+\n",
