limit_per_node = 5; player = .\\*; node = .\\*\n\n    checks a region defined via worldedit (`/1`, `/2`) or areas (`area_pos1`, `area_pos2`).\n\n* `//rollback <seconds> <player>`\n    * note: the double slash - this does not override the builtin rollback command\n    * note: requires the same privilege(s) as `rollback`.\n    * note: VERY SLOW AND DANGEROUS. BE CAREFUL. MAKE BACKUPS.\n\n    requires both arguments. reverts all changes by player in the region to what was there before the earliest\n    change after <seconds> seconds ago.\n\n* `/clone_wielded [<count>]`\n\n    makes extras of the item the player is wielded. for tools, the default is 1 (added to the players inventory),\n    for non-tools, the default is the item's stack max size. exceeding the stack size is possible, up to 65535\n",
