A few seconds only is sufficient.\n\nFor gambling debts, dishonour, tedium vitae etc.: Apply DEATH liberally around the edges of the room, near skirting-boards, in cracks in the floor, in any dark cranny. Repeat every four to five hours.\n\nFor mystical ecstasy: Use DEATH having placed yourself approximately one meter from clothing, curtains, carpets.\n\nDEATH can be used in wardropes and wall-cupboards. Shut them immediately after each application.\n\nDEATH is recommened in Spring, from April onwards.\n\nDEATH IS GOOD FOR YOU. NON-TOXIC.\n\n## license\n\nsee LICENSE.md\n\n### Authors of source code\n* Originally by PilzAdam (MIT)\n* Various Minetest developers and contributors ?-2022, (MIT)\n* Flux 2022 (LGPL)\n\n### Authors of media (textures)\nAll textures: paramat (CC BY-SA 3.0)\n\n","maintainers":["rheo"],"media_license":"CC-BY-SA-3.0","name":"bones","provides":["bones"],"release":24470,"repo":"https://github.com/fluxionary/minetest-bones_redo","score":10.2,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/bc709723b6.png"],"short_description":"the bones mod from minetest_game, but with updates to make them much more reliable","state":"APPROVED","tags":["pve","storage","survival"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/bc709723b6.png","title":"bones (redo)","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/rheo/bones/releases/24470/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"rheo/bones":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"futil","packages":["zanderdev/skyblock_zero","rheo/futil"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"fmod","packages":["rheo/fmod","zanderdev/skyblock_zero"]}],"rheo/fmod":[],"rheo/futil":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"fmod","packages":["rheo/fmod","zanderdev/skyblock_zero"]}]},"hash":"174f4zqaxni76sfvkrkkx9rxb618bjscs6lb0g0bvljazdh0kdaz"}
