  "long_description": "# limit_physics_monoids\n\noverrides monoids controlling player physics provided by player_monoids, to limit how big they can grow.\n\n### why\n\nthe physics overrides are multiplicative factors controlling player speed, jump strength, and gravity.\n\nit may make sense for one mod, or another, to double the speed of a player. however, there's multiple reasons to *not*\nscale them multiplicatively, or even additively.\n1. IRL, doubling your speed requires *quadrupling* your energy input.\n  doubling your speed twice requires increasing your energy input 16x. these energy requirements get even worse when\n  you take air resistance and other friction into consideration.\n2. in minetest, you generally accelerate to maximum speed almost instantly.\n  (i've just discovered the\n  [movement_acceleration_*](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/blob/3e148e2810a2b1bb47cada2bd431df8f0bad2f96/builtin/settingtypes.txt#L767-L777)\n  parameters, and there's a pending PR to add these to the physics overrides...)\n\n### how\n\nthe composed (folded) result value for the physics trait is passed through a \"limiter\" function, which scales the\nvalue.\n\nproperties of a limiter:\n\n* continuous\n\n* nondecreasing\n\n* f(0) = 0\n  it should remain possible to completely disable the functioning of the physic\n\n* f(1) = 1\n  no change should remain no change.\n\n* f\\'(x) differentiable, decreasing when x > 1\n  it should decrease smoothly.\n\n3 limiters are currently provided:\n\n* atanh\n  values increase near-linearly at first, but drop off to a constant maximum.\n\n* gamma\n  growth is limited by a constant exponent\n\n* log__n\n  growth is limited as log^n, which is \"flatter\" than gamma, but trickier to optimize\n\n| limiter | param_1 | param_2 | 0 | 1 | 2    | 4    | 8    | 12   | 16   | 32   |\n| ------- | ------- | ------- | - | - | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| gamma   | 0.57    | N/A     | 0 | 1 | 1.48 | 2.20 | 3.27 | 4.12 | 4.86 | 7.21 |\n| log__n  | 2       | 0.1     | 0 | 1 | 1.65 | 2.49 | 3.49 | 4.12 | 4.59 | 5.76 |\n| tanh    | 3       | N/A     | 0 | 1 | 2    | 3.37 | 4.05 | 4.11 | 4.11 | 4.11 |\n",
