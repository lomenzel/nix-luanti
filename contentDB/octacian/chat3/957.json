Messages in which the receiving player's name is mentioned are highlighted in a light green, as are PMs. Messages in which the first character is a ! are highlighted in red to all players (also known as a shout). Important messages (mentions or shouts) also cause a bell to be played to players if chat3.bell is true and the player hasn't disabled the chatbell using the /chatbell command. Everything mentioned here can also be configured, and is documented below in the Configuration section.","maintainers":["octacian"],"media_license":"CC-BY-SA-3.0","name":"chat3","provides":["chat3"],"release":957,"repo":"https://github.com/octacian/chat3","score":3.6,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/frhIymnFWj.png"],"short_description":"Makes chat on a populated server much easier to understand and keep up with.","state":"APPROVED","tags":["chat","multiplayer"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/frhIymnFWj.png","title":"Chat3","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/octacian/chat3/releases/957/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"octacian/chat3":[]},"hash":"1xab2j23vxprjmjrrx2bcp8xv9rpr6xi48iw2vm08hgxq8hhxmfw"}
