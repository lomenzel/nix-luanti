  "long_description": "This mod uses the function introduced in this [pull request](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/pull/2827) by [TeTpaAka](https://github.com/TeTpaAka). Hands is mostly for demostration purposes for the reference of other modders or for players to mess around with. Keep in mind that the mod does **not** work on Minetest 0.4.14, as the feature was not introduced until Minetest 0.4.15.\n\nThe mod registers a single chatcommand (`/sethand`) and privilege (`sethand`), allowing the player to set their own hand to any node or item. Hands also has a simple API with which two example hands are registered as listed below.\n\n### Alternate Hands\n* `hands:grey`\n* `hands:space`\n\nThe textures aren't very good, but it allows you to get a basic and functional overview of the new feature.\n\n### Chatcommand\n```\n/sethand hands:grey\n/sethand default:stick\n```\n\nThe above example shows that the `/sethand` command works both with the hands introduced by the mod or with any other node or item already in the game. Remember to grant yourself the `sethand` privilege before attempting to use the chatcommand.\n\n### API\nThough I highly doubt that this mod would actually need an API and be expanded as a stand-alone mod, I decided to provide one in case somebody wanted to. Overall, it's pretty single. The only required parameter is the `itemstring`/`handstring`.\n\n```lua\nhands.register_hand(<itemstring>, {\n  wield_image = <wield image>,\n  wield_scale = <wield scale>,\n  tool_capabilities = <tool capabilities>,\n})\n```\n\nAll of the fields except for the itemstring are optional, though it's pretty pointless to register a new hand without a wield image.\n\n#### API Examples\nSimplistic:\n```lua\nhands.register_hand(\"hands:space\", {\n  wield_image = \"hands_space.png\",\n})\n```\n\nFine Tuned:\n```lua\nhands.register_hand(\"hands:space\", {\n  wield_image = \"hands_space.png\",\n  wield_scale = {x=1,y=1,z=2.5},\n  tool_capabilities = {\n  \t\tfull_punch_interval = 0.9,\n  \t\tmax_drop_level = 0,\n  \t\tgroupcaps = {\n  \t\t\tcrumbly = {times={[2]=3.00, [3]=0.70}, uses=0, maxlevel=1},\n  \t\t\tsnappy = {times={[3]=0.40}, uses=0, maxlevel=1},\n  \t\t\toddly_breakable_by_hand = {times={[1]=3.50,[2]=2.00,[3]=0.70}, uses=0}\n  \t\t},\n  \t\tdamage_groups = {fleshy=1},\n  \t}\n})\n```",
