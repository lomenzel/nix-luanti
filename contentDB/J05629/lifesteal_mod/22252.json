  "long_description": "### Important Things To Know:\n1. Mod must be called when **first loading** into the world, otherwise the mod will be broken. (Fixed in 3.2.0)\n2. As of December 4, 2022, MineClone2 is incompatible with the mod until further notice.\n3. Most versions before 3.0.0 depend on `hudbars`.\n4. I will only be updating this pack for any bugs and ideas I have in mind.\n5. Based off of the Lifesteal SMP in Minecraft.\n\n### How the mod works:\n1. When you die, you lose a heart.\n2. When you kill a player, you get the heart. If you have max hearts, the heart will turn into an item and enter your inventory if it has room, otherwise it will spawn on the ground.\n3. You can withdraw hearts using the  '/withdraw [<hearts>] command. You need the withdraw privilege in order to execute that.\n\n## Updates\n\n\n|Date|Version |Description|\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n|11/26/2023|3.2.0|Finally found the bug and added some minor changes.|\n|9/9/2023|3.1.0|Fixed an offset bug.|\n|9/1/2023|3.0.0|Finally made `hudbars` an optional dependency, from using code from [Capture the Flag.](https://content.minetest.net/packages/rubenwardy/capturetheflag/)|\n|8/9/2023|2.0.0|Rewrote most of the mod frame. Should be stable version now.|\n|12/4/2022|1.3.0|Created the revive lantern, updated the /withdraw command. MineClone 2 does not work with the mod.|",
