Adds northern/southern lights at night.\nSince the Minetest world doesn't exactly have polar regions, auroras will appear in any sufficiently cold place.\nBe patientâ€”auroras aren't always visible!\n\n### Features:\n\n- Different auroras every night, with semi-realistic colors.\n- Players near each other see similar colors.\n- Configurable, no media/assets.\n\nThis mod works with Minetest 5.2.0 or later, and is compatible with TestificateMods' Climate API/Regional Weather mods.\nIt probably won't work with other mods/games that regularly change the skybox.",
