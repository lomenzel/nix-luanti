Copy the \"yl_ticker\" folder to your mod directory.\n2. Enable the mod in your world.mt file.\n\n## Configuration\n\n```\nyl_ticker.debug = false\n```\nSet to true to enable debug mode\n\n```\nyl_ticker.save_path\n```\nSet this to where in the worldfolder you want the JSON files stored.\n\n```\nyl_ticker.chatcommand_domain\n```\nSet this to what the chatcommand should start with. Default is ticker, so chatcommands start with `/ticker_` but if you set it to \"towncrier\", chatcommands will start with `/towncrier_`\n\n```\nyl_ticker.colour\n```\nSet this to the colour you want the ticker have in chat\n\n```\nyl_ticker.frequency\n```\nSet this to the default repeat timer you want the ticker have in chat. 3600 means \"once per hour\"\n\n```\nyl_ticker.examples\n```\n\nSet this to what the examples command should display. Break line with `\n`\n\n```\nyl_ticker.user_privs\nyl_ticker.admin_privs\n```\nSet those to the list of privs you want to allow the execution of the corresponding commands:\n\nyl_ticker.user_privs allows\n* listing single ticker\n* copy single ticker\n* listing all tickers\n* Show help\n* Show examples\n\nyl_ticker.admin_privs allows\n* listing single ticker\n* copy single ticker\n* listing all tickers\n* add ticker\n* delete ticker\n* say ticker to main chat\n* say all tickers to main chat\n\n## Usage\n\nThis mod targets servers, but should work in singleplayer, too. It comes with no direct content but exposes functions you can use in your mod.\n\n### Data structure\n\nOne ticker consists of an id, a message, an owner, a runtime and a frequency. Example:\n\n```\n{\n    id = 1,\n    creation_date = os.time(),\n    message = \"[EVENT] Don't forget to join the event tonight!\",\n    owner = \"Admin\",\n    runtime = 1000000,\n    frequency = 3600,\n    param = \"[EVENT] Don't forget to join the event tonight!$3600$1000000\"\n}\n```\n\nThose tickers sit in a table with `id` as index:\n\n```\n{\n    1 = {ticker},\n    2 = {ticker},\n    [5] = {ticker}\n}\n```\n\n### Chatcommands\n\n```\n/ticker_add message$frequency in seconds/minutes/hours/days/weeks$runtime in seconds/minutes/hours/days/weeks/utc\n```\n\nSends the message each frequency for runtime or until timestamp.\n\nTime distances may be given as `60s` or `60 s`, allowed units are s = second, m = minute, h = hour, d = day and w = week.\n\nRuntime may also be given as an enddate in utc timestamp `1704117600utc` or `1704117600 utc`\n\n```\n/ticker_copy ticker_id\n```\n\nOpen the ticker with ID in a formspec, so it can be copied.\n\n```\n/ticker_delete ticker_id\n```\n\nDelete the ticker ID.\n\n```\n/ticker_list\n```\n\nList attributes of ticker with ID to you.\n\n```\n/ticker_list_all\n```\n\nLists all tickers to you.\n\n```\n/ticker_say ticker_id\n```\n\nSay the ticker with ID in main chat.\n\n```\n/ticker_say_all\n```\n\nSay all tickers in main chat.\n\n```\n/ticker_help\n```\n\nDisplays a help overview of all ticker-related commands\n\n```\n/ticker_examples\n```\n\nShows a formspec with (configurable) examples people can copy out of\n\n### Modmakers\n\nUse the following public functions to get, set, list and remove ticker\n\n```\nyl_ticker.get(ticker_id)\n```\n\nReturns a table with the values of this ticker_id. Returns `nil`, if it does not exist. Returns `false, \"errormessage\"` if an error occurred.\n\n```\nyl_ticker.set(message, frequency, runtime, owner, param)\n```\n\nAdds this ticker to the list and returns `true, ticker_id` if accepted, `false, \"errormessage\"` if not.\n\n```\nyl_ticker.formspec(ticker_id)\n```\n\nReturns `true, formspecstring` if a ticker was found, with formspecstring including the `/ticker_add` string, so it can be easily copied from. Returns `false, errormessage` if an error occurred.\n\n```\nyl_ticker.delete(ticker_id)\n```\n\nReturns `true, {ticker}` if one ticker was successfully removed, `false, \"errormessage\"` otherwise.\n\n```\nyl_ticker.list()\n```\n\nReturns `true, { id = {ticker}, ... }` if one or more ticker were found or `false, {}` if none were found.\n\n```\nyl_ticker.say(ticker_id, target)\n```\n\nReturns `true, {ticker}` if one ticker was found or `false, {}` if none were found.\n\n## Limitations\n\n* No colours\n* No tags like \\[EVENT\\]\n\n## Alternatives\n\n* For immediate one-time ticker, use the notification mod\n* For future one-time ticker, use the yl_scheduler mod\n\n## Supported versions\n\nIf you run yl_ticker, but something is wrong, please [file a bug](https://gitea.your-land.de/your-land/yl_ticker/issues/new). PRs also welcome.\n\nThere is no reason to believe it doesn't work anywhere, but you never know.\n\n## Allied projects\n\nIf you know a project that uses this mod tell us and we will add it to the list.\n\n## Uninstall\n\nRemove it from your mod folder or deactivate it in your world.mt\n\nMods that depend on it will cease to work, if the mod is removed without proper replacement.\n\n## License\n\nSee [LICENSE.md](https://gitea.your-land.de/your-land/yl_ticker/src/LICENSE.md)\n\n* Code MIT AliasAlreadyTaken\n* Screenshot CC0 Styxcolor\n\n## Thank you\n\n* Styxcolor\n",
