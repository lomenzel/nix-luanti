  "long_description": "# yl_canned_food_mtg\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis mod brings crafting recipes, nutritional values and unified inventory integration for yl_canned_food\n\n## Download\n\nGet it from https://gitea.your-land.de/your-land/yl_canned_food_mtg\n\n## Dependencies\n\nSee [mod.conf](https://gitea.your-land.de/your-land/yl_canned_food_mtg/src/branch/master/mod.conf)\n\n* [yl_canned_food](https://gitea.your-land.de/your-land/yl_canned_food)\n\n## Installation\n\n1.

Enable the mod in your world.mt file.\n\n## Configuration\n\n```\nyl_canned_food_mtg.debug = false\n```\nSet to true to enable debug mode\n\n```\nyl_canned_food_mtg.enable_recipes = true\n```\nSet this to true if you want to enable recipes. Set this to false if you create recipes of your own in a different mod.\n\n```\nyl_canned_food_mtg.enable_eat = true\n```\nSet this to true if you want to enable eating. Set this to false if you create item_eat integration of your own in a different mod.\n\n```\nyl_canned_food_mtg.enable_unified_inventory = true\n```\nSet this to true if you want to enable unified_inventory integration\n\n```\nyl_canned_food_mtg.data_source = \"default\"\n```\nSet this to where the data shall be loaded from.
