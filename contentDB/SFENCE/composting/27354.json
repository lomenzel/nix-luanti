Some plants (from mod farming, [Farming Redo](https://content.minetest.net/packages/TenPlus1/farming/) and hades_extrafarming) grows faster on garden soil.\n\nThe electric composter can be powered by power generators, technic, elepower, techage or factory electric (require appliances).\n\nSee settingtypes.txt for check configuration posibilities.",
