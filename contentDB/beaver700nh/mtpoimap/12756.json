They can\nbe broken by hand or using an axe.\n\n## How to use\n\nPut map images in `textures/` and point-of-interest list files in `pois/`. Then\nuse this command to get a POI Map:\n\n```\n/giveme mtpoimap:mtpoimap\n```\n\nOnce you do that, you can place it down and right-click it. This will open up\nthe following dialog:\n\n![POI Map Setup Dialog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beaver700nh/mtpoimap/main/scrots/init_dlg.png)\n\nIn the first box, type a title for the map. This will be displayed when players\nhover over the map or when the map is opened. In the second box, type the name\nof the map file to use as the background. _Do not type any directories or paths\nhere, only the file name!_ Finally, in the third box, type the path to the POI\nlist file, relative to the mod root directory. These files are usually stored\nin the `pois/` directory. After filling in all the boxes, press enter. The POI\nmap should update its hover text to whatever title you provided:\n\n![POI Map Hover Text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beaver700nh/mtpoimap/main/scrots/hover_text.png)\n\nNow right-click on the POI Map. You should see a dialog like this:\n\n![POI Map After Setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beaver700nh/mtpoimap/main/scrots/after_setup.png)\n\nAgain note that the title you provided is displayed at the top. Also, the map\nimage you provided should be displayed in the background of the dialog. Circle\nshaped icons should also appear according to what is listed in the provided\nPOI list file. Hovering over these icons will display the hover text provided\nin the file. Finally, the \"Reload\" button in the top-right corner can be used\nto update the points on the map should the POI list file be modified after the\nPOI map is set up.\n\n## POI List File Syntax\n\nPOI list files have a simple syntax. Each line corresponds to one point on the\nmap, and has the following format:\n\n```\nx_pos, y_pos | icon_color | Hover Text\n```\n\n`x_pos` and `y_pos` form a coordinate pair ranging from (-1, -1) which is the\ntop left corner to (1, 1) which is the bottom right. (0, 0) is the center of\nthe map. `icon_color` is a string which can have any of the following values:\n\n```\nred\norange\nyellow\ngreen\nblue\npurple\nviolet\nmagenta\ngrey\ngray\n```\n\n`grey` is an alias for `gray` and `violet` is an alias for `purple`. More icon\ncolors can be added by adding more `mtpoimap_poiicon_<COLOR>.png` files in the\n`textures/` directory.\n\n`Hover Text` is any string that will be displayed as the tooltip when the point\nis hovered over. It may contain the escape sequences `\\r`, `\n` and `\\t`, which\nwill be converted into their respective control characters. Double backslashes\nmay be used to insert literal escape sequences into the tooltip. Percent signs\nmay also be used in the hover text but backslashes preceding percent signs must\nbe doubled to be shown in the tooltip.\n","maintainers":["beaver700nh"],"media_license":"CC-BY-SA-4.0","name":"mtpoimap","provides":["mtpoimap"],"release":12756,"repo":"https://github.com/beaver700nh/mtpoimap","score":5.2,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/0cb0ebe363.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/8ac0c2f461.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/34b96d1e34.png"],"short_description":"Displays a map with points of interest, for any game (no dependencies).","state":"APPROVED","tags":["creative","decorative","gui","server_tools"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/0cb0ebe363.png","title":"MT POI Map","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/beaver700nh/mtpoimap/releases/12756/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"beaver700nh/mtpoimap":[]},"hash":"15m3ypcbk3mg5y1vybik6a6gn3lh112y5lmqv9z2zkjdkaw6lyqw"}
