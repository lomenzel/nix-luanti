Files need to be named `nc_skins_player_`*playername*`.png`, where *playername* is the exact name of the player.\n\n**N.B. after installing or changing skins, *the server needs to be restarted* for the changes to take effect**\n\n### Enabling skins\n\nPlayers' skins will only display if:\n\n- The skin was present at the time the server was started, and\n- The player either has the `nc_skins` priv, or the `nc_skins_nopriv` setting is enabled\n\n### Configuration\n\nSee [settingtypes.txt](https://gitlab.com/sztest/nc_skins/-/raw/master/settingtypes.txt) for more configuration options.",
