This is useful for things like the place/zap node commands, or firing weapons, which you are likely to want to do repeatedly without opening the chat interface each time.\n- Each command has an individual privilege so you can grant access per-player.  There is also an \"all\" privilege for convenience.\n- Each command can be run targeting another player, in which case it will affect that player as if they were the one to run the command (though using *your* privilege for the check).  This allows you to e.g. administer which colors a player has access to, to allow them to join a late-game party without having to make everyone wait while they beat the early bosses.\n\nAdded commands include:\n\n- `/bind` to bind a command to the hotkey for your currently-selected color.\n- `/colors` (or `/colours`) to set which colors you have access to.\n- `/pn` to place a new node as if you had just hopped red (but without having to stand on red or do the rigamarole of using a \"crane\").\n- `/zap` to destroy the node you are pointing at (works on walls too).\n- `/lo`, `/hi`, `/ap` and `/ion` to fire various surface-to-air weapons.\n- `/summon` to summon a dragon as if an altar existed where your feet are.\n- `/unbuild` to convert an \"activated\" or \"spent\" building back into its original nodes, so it can be triggered again.\n- `/fov` to grant a player the ability to zoom in.\n- `/lag` to introduce artificial lag to the server step, useful for testing robustness of mechanics under non-ideal server loading effects.\n\nSee the in-game `/help` for a full list of commands.","maintainers":["Warr1024"],"media_license":"MIT","name":"hopcheat","provides":["hopcheat"],"release":26208,"repo":"https://gitlab.com/sztest/hopcheat","score":1.9,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/6acc490daa.webp"],"short_description":"Cheat commands for ColourHop","state":"APPROVED","tags":["chat","creative","server_tools","tools","world_tools"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/6acc490daa.png","title":"HopCheat","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/Warr1024/hopcheat/releases/26208/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"Warr1024/hopcheat":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"ch_player_api","packages":["talas/colourhop"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"ch_colours","packages":["talas/colourhop"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"ch_ion_cannon","packages":["talas/colourhop"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"ch_fireworks","packages":["talas/colourhop"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"ch_flashscreen","packages":["talas/colourhop"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"ch_world","packages":["talas/colourhop"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"ch_draconis","packages":["talas/colourhop"]}]},"hash":"1alkpr878cjbig4mkfyqr0f0fw1m2qya8k42f66324wxq7crs9a1"}
