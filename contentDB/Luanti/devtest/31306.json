  "long_description": "**Development Test** (or **DevTest** in short) is a basic testing environment that contains a bunch of things to test the engine, but it could also be used as a minimal testbed for testing out mods. This is for developers, not for players.\n\n## Features\n* Basic nodes for mapgen\n* Basic, minimal map generator\n* Lots of example nodes for testing drawtypes, param2, light level, and many other node properties\n* Example entities\n* Other example items\n* Formspec test (via `/test_formspec` command)\n* Automated unit tests (disabled by default)\n* Tools for manipulating nodes and entities, like the \"Param2 Tool\"\n\n## Getting started\nBasically, just create a world and start. A few important things to note:\n\n* Items are gotten from the “Chest of Everything” (`chest_of_everything:chest`) or “Bag of Everything” (`chest_of_everything:bag`)\n* When you lost your initial items, type in `/stuff` command to get them back\n* By default, Creative Mode activates infinite node placement. This behavior can be changed with the `devtest_infplace` setting\n* Use the `/infplace` command to toggle infinite node placement in-game\n* Use the Param2 Tool to change the param2 of nodes; it's useful to experiment with the various drawtype test nodes\n* Check out the game settings and server commands for additional tests and features\n\nConfused by a certain node or item? Check out for inline code comments. The usages of most tools are explained in their tooltips.\n\n### Example tests\n* You can use this to test what happens if a player is simultaneously in 2 nodes with `damage_per_second` but with a different value.\n* Or use the Falling Node Tool on various test nodes to see how they behave when falling.\n* You could also use this as a testbed for dependency-free mods, e.g. to test out how your formspecs behave without theming.\n\n\n## Source code\nThe source code of DevTest is included in the Luanti repository and can be found [here](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/tree/master/games/devtest).\n\n## More information\n\nSee the [Wiki page](https://wiki.minetest.net/Games/Development_Test) or the [README.md file](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/blob/master/games/devtest/README.md) for more.\n",
