  "long_description": "The crowbars are designed to bypass the durability system altogether. So, if you are annoyed by having to repair or to make tools when building, mining or anything that involves breaking blocks (or damaging entities), this mod is a great option. Two crowbars are at your disposal: the iron crowbar and the netherite crowbar (yes, this mod was historically designed for Mineclonia/Voxelibre only). The netherite crowbar is obviously a direct upgrade to the iron one. In Mineclonia/Voxelibre, they can be enchanted with the same enchantments as every axe.\n\n**Recipe for iron crowbar:**\n\n*Minetest Game (default):*\n* 3 steel ingots\n* 1 bronze ingot\n\n*Mineclonia/Voxelibre (mcl_core):*\n* 3 iron ingots\n* 1 copper ingot\n\n**Recipe for netherite crowbar:**\n\n*Minetest Game (default):*\n* 1 iron crowbar\n* 1 mese crystal\n* 1 lava bucket\n \n*Mineclonia/Voxelibre (mcl_core):*\n* 1 iron crowbar\n* 1 netherite ingot",
