Any suggestions or ideas for new realms are welcome!\n\nThis mod has been developed on minetest 5.7.0-dev, but should work on 5.6.0. It **will not work** on versions under 5.6.0.\n\n\n### Notes\nAs this mod has several lua mapgens (but only one should be working at any one time in singleplayer...), it is fairly slow and can cause severe lag, but from my tests, it remains consistantly playable on singleplayer. \n\nUse the welcome book or /welcome for information about how to start out.\n\n\n### License\nCode: LGPL v2.1\n\nTextures & models: CC BY-SA 3.0\n\nThank you very much to @theraven262 for lots of the textures!\n\nThanks also to paramat for all his help with mapgen, and for his example mods. The code of the floatlands is, for its starting point, based on his [fracture](https://github.com/paramat/fracture) mod.\n\n### Depends:\n- [Biomegen](https://gitlab.com/gaelysam/Biomegen)\n- [Ethereal](https://notabug.org/tenplus1/ethereal)\n- Dependencies in Minetest Game: default, stairs, fire, flowers, butterflies,
