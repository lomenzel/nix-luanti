  "long_description": "This mod contains various bricks mostly at this time, and a few others. There will be more content in the future.\n\nAs of now there are no plans for adding crafting recipes to create these nodes in survival, nor do they generate naturally in the world, the mod is intended to be used in a creative world.\n\nMore content will be added in the future. This is under active development. I will try to avoid removing nodes from previous versions so that no missing nodes will appear in the world, but that is possible to happen in these early stages of development. Expect the textures and visuals to change over time more or less.\nThis mod is primarily targeting Minetest Game and Mineclonia / VoxeLibre, but may also work in other games (not tested)",
