  "long_description": "This Minetest mod lets you use LuaJIT's builtin profiler. This profiler is good\nfor pinpointing expensive parts of mod code.\n\n## How to Use\n- Add the mod to the `secure.trusted_mods` list.\n- Enable the mod.\n- In-game start the profiler with `/jitprofiler_start 1 <filename>`. The\n  profiling data will be written to `<worldpath>/jitprofiles/<filename>`.\n- Collect data for a while.\n- Stop profiling with `/jitprofiler_stop` or by exiting the world.\n- Download FlameGraph if you haven't done so.\n- Create a flame graph SVG with\n  `./flamegraph.pl <worldpath>/jitprofiles/<filename> > graph.svg`.\n- Open the SVG with your browser or another viewing program.\n- The top level of each stack snapshot will be \"C\", \"G\", \"I\", \"J\", or \"N\", representing C code, garbage collection, interpreter, JIT compilation, or compiled code, respectively.\n\n## Issues\n- This mod can cause the game to hang somehow. Most of the profiling data collected before the hang is saved.\n- Sometimes a lot of C code execution is reported in suspicious places. I think this represents time taken by the Minetest engine, but I don't know why the profiler thinks the code is executed inside a Lua function.\n- Using this mod with Mesecons luacontrollers can cause crashes for some reason.\n",
