  "long_description": "## Overview\n\nThis is a library mod for Minetest that simplifies associating objects with\nnodes. Sometimes nodes need to be displayed or animated in a way that nodes do\nnot lend themselves to. In these cases, it can be helpful to use an object.\n\n## API\n\n### `node_object.set(pos, object)`\n\nSets the object associated with the node position. If a different object is\nalready associated, this object is removed. If `object` is `nil`, the\nassociation is cleared.\n\nIt is recommended that the object have its property `static_save` set to\n`false`, since the association is only in-memory.\n\nIn addition, you should optionally depend on `mesecons_mvps` and register the\nobject's entity type as unmoveable using that mod's API.\n\n### `node_object.get(pos)`\n\nReturns the object (or `nil`) associated with the node position. This will\nreturn `nil` if the object has been removed or deactivated.\n\n### `node_object.swap(pos, object)`\n\nThis is like `node_object.set`, but instead of being removed, the past object\n(or `nil`) is returned.\n\n### Node callback `_node_object_set(pos)`\n\nAn object associated with a node is an ephemeral reflection of the node's state.\nBy providing this callback in a node definition, you are telling the library to\ncall it with a node position as its argument when the node may not have an\nassociated object, such as after placement or loading, and to remove any\nassociated object before destruction. If the node state changes, you should\nupdate the object yourself.\n\nNote: you cannot set this callback within an `on_mods_loaded` callback.\n\n### `node_object.version`\n\nThis is the library's version string. I'll try to stick to SemVer.\n",
