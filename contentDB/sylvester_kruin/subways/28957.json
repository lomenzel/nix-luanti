New trains will be worked on when I have the time, you can see the [open issues on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/SamMatzko/luanti-subways/issues) for a list of the trains that will be added.\n\n> **WARNING**\n> \n> Unfortunately, the 2.x update brings breaking changes. If you have a pre-2.x version installed, be aware that the new subway trains have different names, so any existing Green Subway Wagon or Red Subway Wagon trains will no longer appear correctly.\n\n> **NOTE**\n> \n> Aliases have now been registered for backwards compatibility with 1.x. However, for the feature to work, you need to use the [AdvTrains patch \"Alias for wagon types\"](https://lists.sr.ht/~gpcf/advtrains-devel/patches/54786).\n>\n> The displays are now set using the first line of the \"Outside Text\" field.\n\n## Features\nHere are some features that Subways 2 brings:\n\n- Support for [AdvTrains Livery Tools](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Marnack/advtrains_livery_tools/)\n- Exterior displays with expansive Unicode support\n- Removal of development assets to a [different repository](https://codeberg.org/SamMatzko/luanti-subways-dev-assets) to reduce package size\n\n## Usage\n### Setting the train color\nThis mod supports [AdvTrains Livery Tools](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Marnack/advtrains_livery_tools/). To change the color of a subway car, punch it with the Livery Designer Tool.\n\n### Setting the outside display text\nThe outside displays now show the first line of text from the \"Outside Text\" field. Version 2.x has [unicode_text](https://content.minetest.net/packages/erlehmann/unicode_text/) support, so thousands of Unicode characters can be used. Just enter the driver stand, select \"Onboard Computer,\" and type in the \"Outside Text\" text box, as you would for any AdvTrains train.\n\n## Have any ideas and/or contributions?\n\nIf you have any ideas for more subways to be added, feel free to [open an issue on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/SamMatzko/luanti-subways/issues/new). Bear in mind that I'm still in school, so I'll have limited time during the academic year to work on new trains.\n\nIf you have a modification you've made and you'd like to submit it, you're welcome to [open a pull request](https://codeberg.org/SamMatzko/luanti-subways/compare/master...master).\n\nDevelopment assets for this repository are stored at [luanti-subways-dev-assets](https://codeberg.org/SamMatzko/luanti-subways-dev-assets).\n\n## Licenses\nThe code is licensed under the [AGPL-3.0](https://codeberg.org/SamMatzko/luanti-subways/src/branch/master/LICENSE.txt); all media (3D files, image textures, etc.) is licensed under [CC-BY-SA-3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).\n","maintainers":["sylvester_kruin"],"media_license":"CC-BY-SA-3.0","name":"subways","provides":["subways","subways_01700_series","subways_lrv_type_9"],"release":28957,"repo":"https://codeberg.org/SamMatzko/luanti-subways","score":758.1,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/8d79251b72.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/ee9bae5150.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/5dbfc94110.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/aa6a236506.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/af732db1b6.png"],"short_description":"Nice, customizable subways for Advanced Trains (advtrains)","state":"APPROVED","tags":["transport"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/8d79251b72.png","title":"Subways","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/sylvester_kruin/subways/releases/28957/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"erlehmann/tga_encoder":[],"erlehmann/unicode_text":[],"orwell/advtrains":[],"sylvester_kruin/subways":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"advtrains","packages":["orwell/advtrains"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"tga_encoder","packages":["Wuzzy/mineclone2","VoxelForge/voxelforge","ryvnf/mineclonia","erlehmann/tga_encoder"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"advtrains_train_track","packages":["orwell/advtrains"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"unicode_text","packages":["erlehmann/unicode_text","Wuzzy/repixture"]}]},"hash":"14s8kcwq7ydvwxkq200lzzqvax180qj3wscyf03jdrqxv9r2wbij"}
