  "long_description": "This mod aims to add several unique, real-world subway trains to Luanti's Advanced Trains. New trains will be worked on when I have the time, you can see the [open issues on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/SamMatzko/luanti-subways/issues) for a list of the trains that will be added.\n## Features\nHere are some features that Subways 2 brings:\n\n- Support for [AdvTrains Livery Tools](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Marnack/advtrains_livery_tools/)\n- Exterior displays with expansive Unicode support\n- Removal of development assets to a [different repository](https://codeberg.org/SamMatzko/luanti-subways-dev-assets) to reduce package size\n\n## Usage\n### Setting the train color\nThis mod supports [AdvTrains Livery Tools](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Marnack/advtrains_livery_tools/). To change the color of a subway car, punch it with the Livery Designer Tool.\n\n### Setting the outside display text\nThe outside displays now show the first line of text from the \"Outside Text\" field. Version 2.x has [unicode_text](https://content.minetest.net/packages/erlehmann/unicode_text/) support, so thousands of Unicode characters can be used. Just enter the driver stand, select \"Onboard Computer,\" and type in the \"Outside Text\" text box, as you would for any AdvTrains train.\n\n## Have any ideas and/or contributions?\n\nIf you have any ideas for more subways to be added, feel free to [open an issue on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/SamMatzko/luanti-subways/issues/new). Bear in mind that I'm still in school, so I'll have limited time during the academic year to work on new trains.\n\nIf you have a modification you've made and you'd like to submit it, you're welcome to [open a pull request](https://codeberg.org/SamMatzko/luanti-subways/compare/master...master).\n\nDevelopment assets for this repository are stored at [luanti-subways-dev-assets](https://codeberg.org/SamMatzko/luanti-subways-dev-assets).\n\n## Licenses\nThe code is licensed under the [AGPL-3.0](https://codeberg.org/SamMatzko/luanti-subways/src/branch/master/LICENSE.txt); all media (3D files, image textures, etc.) is licensed under [CC-BY-SA-3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).\n",
