  "long_description": "Elepower is a new technology modpack currently in development. The mod is currently in beta and is not complete.\n\nThe \"Compatible games\" list only shows games for which official support is provided. There shouldn't be a reason for this mod not to work anywhere else. As always with such things, ensure that you have backups of your world!\n\n**This mod does not work below Luanti 5.6.0+! No support is provided for outdated versions and backports are not planned. You have been warned.**\n\n## Some features\n* Power and fluid transfer\n* Ore doubling mechanics (Pulverizer + Furnace)\n* Automatic farms (Planter + Harvester)\n* High crafting complexity for crafting lovers\n* A sawmill that gives 6 planks instead of 4 per log!\n* Nuclear Power (Both fission and fusion reactors)\n* Toggle your automation on and off using Mesecons\n* Seeds and other farming produce can be turned into power via Biofuel\n* Gases and (unrealistic, sorry chem nerds!) chemical reactions/processes\n* A mining machine to get an endless supply of ores, as long as you have power!\n* A bunch of materials and derived crafting components you can use in your own mods!\n* Machine usage help available from an in-game guide book or from both craftguide and unified_inventory!\n* ..and a lot more planned!\n\n",
