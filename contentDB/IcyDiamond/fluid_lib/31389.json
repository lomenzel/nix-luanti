  "long_description": "This is a fluid container and transfer API for Luanti. It augments the default bucket mod and adds these features:\n\n* Nodes can now have \"internal buffers\" of fluid.\n* Buckets can be registered with a color instead of an image.\n* Buckets have callbacks that can insert and take fluid from certain nodes with internal buffers.\n* Fluid storage tanks!\n* Fluid transfer nodes!\n\n**Note 1:** Default storage tanks are registered for all fluids that have a bucket.\n\n**Note 2:** \"Connect glass\" needs to be enabled in order for the fluid to show up inside containers. You can find this setting under Graphics and Audio -> Effects.\n\n**Note 3:** \"Compatible games\" list only shows games, where the bucket_compat compatibility library is officially supported. There shouldn't be reason for this mod not to work anywhere else.\n\nAPI documentation is available in the README.",
