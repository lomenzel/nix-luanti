  "long_description": "This is a simple armor mod. \nIt does not require minetest game (or really any game or mod), and is intended to be simple, easy to understand, and flexible enough to support non-standard sorts of armor (e.g. perhaps an amulet of protection).\nIt doesn't contain any actual armors, just an api for creating them. \n\n## Usage \n\nEquip: Right click with it in your hand.\nUnEquip: Right click with empty hand. \n\n(You must not be pointing at any object).\n\nIt uses 'slots' essentially an armor cannot be equipped in a slot that is\nalready occupied. The 'standard' slots are head, torso, arms, legs, feet, but\nyou are not contrained to this. A slot can be anything, for example 'earings'\nwill work just fine for, say, magic earings of protection.\n\n### Texture\n\nTexture is optional, so you can use it for magic items like say a magic\ntalisman of protection. If you need a texture, just use the traditional model\nlayout (see character.png). It will overlay the texture over whatever texture\nyou already have mapped to your player model.\n\n### Creating armor\n\nCreating armor is like creating a craft item, except there is an aditional property 'armor' \n\n[source,lua]\n```lua\nsimple_armor.register(\"titanium:boots\", {\n\n\tdescription = \"Titanium Boots\",\n\n\tinventory_image = \"titanium_boots_item.png\",\n\n\tarmor = {\n\t\tslot = \"feet\",             \n\t\tgroups = { fleshy = 15 },     -- this gives 15% protection. \n\t\ttexture = \"titanium_boots.png\", -- this is overlay on player model\n\t},\n})\n```\n\nThats it! \n\n### Dependancies and support of other mods\n\nThere are no real dependancies on other mods. It has been breify tested with both\n[skinsDB](https://content.minetest.net/packages/bell07/skinsdb/) and\n[simple_skins](https://content.minetest.net/packages/TenPlus1/simple_skins)\n\nAnd seems to work fine with them.\n\nplayer_api etc. is listed as optional depends just to fix module loading order.\n\n### Upcoming features (possibly!) \n* Support for sfinv and other inventories\n* Support for custom armor algorythms \n\n",
