From .HTML, you can create a .PDF using your web browser.\n\nThere's also a setting to disable normal user creation, requiring users to use the accounts you created.\n\nComing soon: all player management\n\nAlso see [Classroom](https://content.minetest.net/packages/rubenwardy/classroom/)\n\n## Settings\n\n* `accountmgr.allow_user_register`: Default true. If enabled, users can create\n  an account. Setting this to false is desirable when you're using bulk account\n  creation and don't want users to be able to create their own accounts.\n\n\n## Bulk Account Creation\n\n### Show the GUI\n\nGrant yourself the server privilege, and then run the chatcommand:\n\n\t/grantme server\n\t/accounts\n\n\n### Importing\n\nYou can import users from a .csv file by placing it in the world directory,\nselecting it in the \"Import from CSV\" list, and clicking import.\n\nThis .csv file can be as simple as a list of player names:\n\n\tplayer1\n\truben.ward\n\nOr you can also include privileges and notes:\n\n\tplayer1, fly fast\n\tplayer2, kick ban, A note\n\nNotes are freeform text, and will appear in the account report\n\n\n### Editing Users\n\nWhen you click \"Save\" in the Create/Update section, it'll copy the fields into\nthe user list. If the user exists, it'll be overridden. Otherwise, a new user\nwill be created in the list.\n\nYou can click a row in the list to copy from the user list to the fields.\n\nTo copy a user, you can click it in the user list, change the name, and then\nclick save.\n\nClicking Delete will delete the user with the given name.\n\n\n### Exporting\n\nClick \"Create Accounts\" to create/update the users and generate the reports.\n\nThe reports will be placed in the world directory. The file name will be\n`new-users-DATE-TIME` where DATE and TIME is when the report was created.\n\nPasswords are only saved to plaintext in the report. It's not possible\nto generate the report again unless you change all the passwords as well.\n\nTo create a PDF file. open the HTML file up in your web browser\n(Chrome/Firefox/Edge) and print it (File > Print, Ctrl+P). Select \"Save as PDF\"\nor \"Print as PDF\" as the printer, and then click print.\n\nMake sure to keep the report safe.","maintainers":["rubenwardy"],"media_license":"MIT","name":"accountmgr","provides":["accountmgr"],"release":12921,"repo":"https://gitlab.com/rubenwardy/accountmgr","score":304,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/8b7a539404.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/baa633c535.png"],"short_description":"Automatically create accounts in bulk, and export to .CSV and .HTML (and .PDF)","state":"APPROVED","tags":["education","server_tools"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/8b7a539404.png","title":"Account Manager","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/rubenwardy/accountmgr/releases/12921/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"rubenwardy/accountmgr":[]},"hash":"1d7w5w6292nqxhf8gs22h9pflqznzl45g4pap4z92jc81kkdyysv"}
