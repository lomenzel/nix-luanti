The mod runs server-side and controls calling player position and look direction, so using client-side movement will obviously cause disruption.\n\nAll commands are placed under `/cc` command which stands for *cinematic camera*. Running the commands requires `fly` privilege (they don't make sense without it anyway).\n\n\n# Camera motions\n\n## 360\n```\n/cc 360 [r=<radius>] [dir=<l|left|r|right>] [v=<velocity>] [fov=<field of view>]\n```\nMove the camera around a center point while keeping the focus on the center.\n\nParameters:\n\n* `r` or `radius` - distance to the center point in the look direction of the player.\n* `dir` or `direction` - direction of the camera motion.\n* `v` or `speed` - speed multiplier.\n* `fov` - Field of View multiplier to create fish eye effect or  zoom on an object.\n\n## Tilt\n```\n/cc tilt [v=<velocity>] [dir=<u|up|d|down>] [fov=<field of view>]\n```\nRotate the camera vertically, like looking up or down.\n\nParameters:\n\n* `dir` or `direction` - direction of the camera motion.\n* `v` or `speed` - speed multiplier.\n* `fov` - Field of View multiplier to create fish eye effect or  zoom on an object.\n## Pan\n```\n/cc pan [v=<velocity>] [dir=<l|left|r|right>] [fov=<field of view>]\n```\nRotate the camera horizontally, like looking to the left or right.\n\nParameters:\n\n* `dir` or `direction` - direction of the camera motion.\n* `v` or `speed` - speed multiplier.\n* `fov` - Field of View multiplier to create fish eye effect or  zoom on an object.\n## Truck\n```\n/cc truck [v=<velocity>] [dir=<l|left|r|right>] [fov=<field of view>]\n```\nMove the camera sideways without changing the angles, like it is on a truck\n\nParameters:\n\n* `dir` or `direction` - direction of the camera motion.\n* `v` or `speed` - speed multiplier.\n* `fov` - Field of View multiplier to create fish eye effect or  zoom on an object.\n## Dolly\n```\n/cc truck [v=<velocity>] [dir=<f|forward|in|b|back|backwards|out>] [fov=<field of view>]\n```\nMove the camera forward or backwards in the look direction. You can rotate the camera in motion to set the desired look angles.\n\nParameters:\n\n* `dir` or `direction` - direction of the camera motion.\n* `v` or `speed` - speed multiplier.\n* `fov` - Field of View multiplier to create fish eye effect or  zoom on an object.\n## Pedestal\n```\n/cc pedestal [v=<velocity>] [dir=<u|up|d|down>] [fov=<field of view>]\n```\nMove the camera vertically. You can rotate the camera in motion to set the desired look angles.\n\nParameters:\n\n* `dir` or `direction` - direction of the camera motion.\n* `v` or `speed` - speed multiplier.\n* `fov` - Field of View multiplier to create fish eye effect or  zoom on an object.\n## Zoom\n```\n/cc zoom [v=<velocity>] [dir=<in|out>] [fov=<field of view>]\n```\nGradually zoom on an object or out into panorama view.\n\nParameters:\n\n* `dir` or `direction` - direction of the camera motion.\n* `v` or `speed` - speed multiplier.\n* `fov` - Initial Field of View multiplier.\n# Camera control\n```\n/cc stop\n```\nStop the camera motion\n```\n/cc revert\n```\nStop and return to initial position.\n# Position control\nManage the list of camera positions stored in the player's metadata. The list survives rejoining and server restarts.\n```\n/cc pos save [name]\n```\nSave the current position and look direction, with an optional name (will be saved in `default` slot if no name provided)\n```\n/cc pos restore [name]\n```\nReturn to the saved position, either `default` or a named one.\n```\n/cc pos clear [name]\n```\nRemove a saved position.\n```\n/cc pos list\n```\nGet a list of saved positions.\n\n","maintainers":["x2048"],"media_license":"AGPL-3.0-only","name":"cinematic","provides":["cinematic"],"release":7122,"repo":"https://github.com/x2048/cinematic","score":12.2,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/HW3WIQdm1t.jpg"],"short_description":"Commands for cinematic camera moves.","state":"APPROVED","tags":["world_tools"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/HW3WIQdm1t.png","title":"Cinematic Camera","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/x2048/cinematic/releases/7122/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"x2048/cinematic":[]},"hash":"03a3wd7lac7h617f8nj43my2apwfqv5q4w59hh5h0sp68pav26r9"}
