  "long_description": "A mod that provides the necessary framework for crafting maps of the local environment from various resources. The mod is structured as an API of sorts, to allow it to be used with any game where such concepts are sensible. \n\n# How to use\nSince Cartographer is an API, it needs at least one additional mod in order to function in your world. There are example mods available for [Minetest Game](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Hugues%20Ross/cartographer_minetest_game/) and [Repixture](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Hugues%20Ross/cartographer_repixture/), and you can make your own to extend these or support other games of your choosing. See the README for more details.\n\n# Contact\nFor questions, requests, and other communications regarding this work, you can contact the original creator at huguesross@posteo.com or open an issue on Codeberg.",
