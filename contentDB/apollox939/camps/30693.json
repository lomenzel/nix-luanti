  "long_description": "Providing a node which can store the world... literally.\n\n### Quick Launch\n\n1. Craft all the parts to craft a Camp (Or `/giveme camps:camp`), then place it somewhere, like outside your home, then get building on it.\n2. Once you're done, Punch the center block (That would show your playername and the camp's id) to pick it all up.\n3. Now as you adventure, tired or need food, or maybe you're on your last pickaxe, just place you're Camp.\n\nI've even done a \\[[Guide](https://gitlab.com/ApolloX939/camps/-/blob/v1.0/guides/readme.md?ref_type=tags) v1.0\\] (Mostly crafting recipes)\n\n> Crafting can be disabled by `camps.craft = false` into you're settings (minetest.conf)\n",
