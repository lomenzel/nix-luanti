  "long_description": "# LightStep\n\nLighter alternative to `globalstep`\n\n## Features\n\n- Configurable step speed\n- Auto Stop/Start\n- Identical API (to that of `core.globalstep`)\n\n## How it works\n\nThe configured \"step speed\" (`lightstep.step_speed`, float, default 1.0) is in seconds, and used directly in a `core.after`\n\nThe number of players online is tracked so the light step can be turned off when no players are on, and restarted when a player joins\n\nThis does mean that the \"step speed\" should never be a huge number, else some mods making use of it would react too slowly (It also means mods which want things running always shouldn't use a light step, because it will get turned off when no players are on)\n\n## Example\n\nThis mod simply sends the player's position (x, y, z) to them in chat\n\n```lua\n-- mod.conf\nname = my_mod\ndepends = lightstep\n```\n\n```lua\n-- init.lua\nlightstep.register_step(function (dtime)\n    --[[ Warning:\n            dtime may be huge, due to the fact the step might have been \n            turned off, so don't use this for any lag detection code\n    --]]\n    for _,player in ipairs(core.get_connected_players()) do\n        local name = player:get_player_name()\n        local pos = player:get_pos()\n        core.chat_send_player(name, \"Pos: \" .. core.pos_to_string(pos, 0))\n    end\nend)\n```\n",
