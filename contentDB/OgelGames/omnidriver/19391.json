  "long_description": "It's the ultimate screwdriver. You'll never need another screwdriver.\n\n### Features\n\n- The only screwdriver (as far as I know) capable of rotating all 8 rotation types.\n- Multiple operation modes, including copy and paste.\n- Soft sounds (no more sonic-boom screwdriver).\n- Unlimited uses (by default, can be changed with a setting).\n\n### Usage\n\nThe omnidriver has four different modes of operation, the first three work similar to each other, while the last one works a bit different.\n\n- Hold the sneak key (default `Shift`) and left-click to cycle between modes.\n\n**Single-axis rotation types**\n\nBecause of their simplicity, the behavior for rotating `4dir`, `color4dir`, `degrotate` and `colordegrotate` are the same between all three rotation modes:\n\n- Left-click or right-click to rotate clockwise (as viewed from above).\n- Hold the special key (default `E`) to reverse direction.\n- For `degrotate` only, right-click allows for more precise rotation.\n\n**1 - Rotate Vertical / Rotate Horizontal**\n\nThis is the simplest mode to use, and the most reliable.\n\n- Left-click to rotate clockwise (as viewed from above).\n- Right-click to rotate towards yourself (think of a wheel rolling towards you).\n- Hold the special key (default `E`) to reverse direction.\n\n**2 - Push Edge / Rotate Pointed**\n\nThis mode will be familiar to anyone that has used the [`rhotator`](https://content.minetest.net/packages/entuland/rhotator/) or [`screwdriver2`](https://content.minetest.net/packages/12Me21/screwdriver2/) mods, as it functions identically. It rotates based on what part of the node you are looking at.\n\n- Left-click to \"push\" the edge you are looking at away from you.\n- Right-click to rotate the face you are looking at clockwise.\n- Hold the special key (default `E`) to reverse direction.\n\n**3 - Rotate Face / Rotate Axis**\n\nThis mode is identical to the default screwdriver in Minetest Game.\n\n- Left-click to rotate to a different face.\n- Right-click to rotate around the node's local \"up\" axis.\n- Hold the special key (default `E`) to reverse direction.\n\n**4 - Paste / Copy**\n\nThis mode is used to copy rotation values between nodes. It only works to copy between \"compatible\" rotation types (for example, it can copy from `facedir` to `colorfacedir`, but not from `facedir` to `degrotate`)\n\n- Left-click to paste a stored rotation to the target node.\n- Right-click to copy the rotation of the target node.\n- Hold the special key (default `E`) to copy or paste a secondary rotation.\n",
