  "long_description": "Timed World Modifiers pick some random nodes from time to time and check if a TWM was registered for that kind of node and execute it if the chance test passes. Node at the surface or ceiling are a bit more likely to be selected than deep ones.\n\nTWM aims to avoid registering a dozen of ABM that could trigger on a wide range of nodes (for example ground nodes) for non-critical effects. It picks a node, assuming it is likely to have a TWM assigned to it.\n\nThis mod doesn't add anything by itself. Check out other mods using the library for effective changes.\n\nLinks:\n\n* [API documentation](https://files.creativekara.fr/minetest/twmlib/twmlib_api.txt) (included in the mod)\n* [All versions](https://files.creativekara.fr/minetest/twmlib/)\n* Clone the repository: <code>git clone https://files.creativekara.fr/git/twmlib.git</code>\n",
