  "long_description": "This mod adds some stair-like nodes from soft ground nodes (sand, dirt, gravel...) that may change shape automatically according to their surroundings.\n\nThe aim of this mod is to make a visual improvement on the world with more curves and smooth movement not to jump on every little height. The library adds an API to register all the alternative 4 shapes and the change shape behavior with one line of code, while keeping some flexibility for the new nodes.\n\nRegistering a natural slope has the following effects:\n\n* Four new nodes are registered based upon the original node definition: the straight slope, the inner corner, the outer corner and the \"pike\" (slab-like)\n* When the map is generated, the blocks are changed to slopes according to the surrounding and the material hardness (defined when registering the slope)\n* When blocks are placed around slopes, they may update their shape to match the new state\n* Nodes that are just placed may also update their shape to match the surroundings\n* If enabled, walking on edges may update the slope shape\n* If enabled, some node may update from time to time\n\nThis mod doesn't add anything by itself. Check out other mods using the library for effective changes, like naturalslopes_minetest_game.\n\nLinks:\n\n* [Documentation and changelog](https://files.creativekara.fr/minetest/naturalslopeslib/doc/)\n* [All versions](https://files.creativekara.fr/minetest/naturalslopeslib/)\n* Clone the repository: <code>git clone https://files.creativekara.fr/git/naturalslopeslib.git</code>",
