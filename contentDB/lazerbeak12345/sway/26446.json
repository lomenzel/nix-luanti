With Sway, formspec size is no longer a limit to your UI or UX. You can have fully dynamic layouts too!\n\nTarget audience is server owners and mod developers. Sway Inv is intended as the core component of a larger, more complete inventory mod. On my Github I have multiple such addons to make sway actually usable, but they are pre-beta phase and are _by far_ not ready for actual use yet.\n\n## Features\n\n- So simple that it doesn't depend on any games in particular.\n- Rich API.\n- Flow forms instead of ridgid and difficult to harden formspec strings\n\n## FAQ\n\nSee [the FAQ section](https://github.com/Lazerbeak12345/sway-inv#faq) of the README on GitHub.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n - [SFINV] Sway is a fork of SFINV by rubenwardy.\n - [Flow] Sway uses flow to render formspecs.\n - [readme.so] Readme (and this trimmed version of the readme) generated in part by readme.so.\n - [i3] Source of inspiration and some (very small amounts) of properly attributed, licence compatible code.\n - [Larry Gelberg][larry] The Sway Inv ascii art was generated via `echo \"Sway Inv.\" | figlet -f larry3d`.\n`larry3d` font is from the official figlet \"contributed\" collection. `pepper`\nfrom the same collection was a close 2nd.\n\n## License\n\nCode: [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) (a copy is bundled at `./CODE_LICENSE.txt`)\n\n* `sway_crafting_arrow.png` - renamed from a texture by paramat, derived from a texture by BlockMen (CC BY-SA 3.0).\n* `sway_hb_bg.png` - renamed from `gui_hb_bg.png`, a texture by BlockMen (CC BY-SA 3.0)\n* `sway_bg_full.png` - renamed from `i3_bg_full.png`, a texture by paramat (CC BY-SA 3.0)\n\nFor a copy of CC BY-SA 3.0 see `./MEDIA_LICENSE.txt` (bundled).\n\n[SFINV]: https://content.luanti.org/packages/rubenwardy/sfinv/\n[Flow]: https://content.luanti.org/packages/luk3yx/flow/\n[readme.so]: https://readme.so\n[i3]: https://content.luanti.org/packages/jp/i3/\n[larry]: http://www.figlet.org/fontdb_example.cgi?font=larry3d.flf\n",
