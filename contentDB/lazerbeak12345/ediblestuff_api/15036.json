  "long_description": "# The Edible Stuff API\n\nA unified API to:\n\n- Mark any item (including tools and armor) as edible\n- Get and set hunger\n\nEdible armor gets \"eaten\" automatically when hunger goes down.\n\nWhen an `edible_while_wearing` armor peice is equipped, the player will eat some\nof that armor if their saturation (or health in absence of a hunger \nmod) is below 85%. This reduces the durability of a random armor piece.\n\nThis mod was created for the [`chocolatestuff`][cs] mod, and so you can make your own armors like it - without needing to depend on `farming`.\n\n[cs]: https://content.minetest.net/packages/lazerbeak12345/chocolatestuff/\n\n> This mod only provides the api to register a tool as edible.\n\n## Requires\n\nNothing! But it has optional integration with:\n\n- `stamina`\n\t- the `minetest-mods` fork\n\t- the `TenPlus1` fork\n\t- the `sofar` fork\n- `hbhunger`\n- `hunger_ng`\n- `3d_armor`\n\t- If absent the armor apis do nothing.\n- `shields`\n- `mcl_hunger`\n\n## API\n\nSee the API section in the README of source control.\n\n## TODO\n\nSee the TODO section in the README of source control.\n\n## Legal\n\nCopyright 2021-2 Lazerbeak12345\n\n### Credit\n\n- The YourLand players for a bunch of questionable ideas for this questionable mod. Original idea was from \"Bla.\"\n- The creator of [the obsidianstuff redo mod](https://content.minetest.net/packages/OgelGames/obsidianstuff). This takes inspiration from that repo (no code or assets).\n- The creator [the edible swords mod][the_edible_swords_mod].
