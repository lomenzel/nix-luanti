  "long_description": "This mod can parse and write CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files from and to strings. Only CSV files that are [RFC 4180](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4180)-compliant are supported to keep it simple.\n\nAccording to RFC 4180, CSV is a file format that stores textual data into a table-like structure, with rows and columns, where each row is separated by [CR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage_return) [LF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_feed), and each value in a row is separated by a comma. It looks like this:\n\n```\napple,pear,orange,pineapple,raspberry\n34,594,330,49430,-403\n\"quotation marks\",\"They said \"\"Hello\"\" to me.\",\"Hello, World!\",\"Luanti\",\"CSV\"\n```\n\nThis mod aims to be as simple as possible by avoiding unnecessary and confusing features. Only the bare minimum, but enough to be useful.\n\n## Features\n\n* Parse a string in CSV format into a Lua table\n* Write a Lua table into a CSV string\n* Full compliance with [RFC 4180](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4180)\n* Values can include any characters, including newlines, commas and quotation marks\n* No bullshit, just CSV",
