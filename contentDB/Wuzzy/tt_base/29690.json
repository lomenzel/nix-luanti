This mod will *not* give you any manual explanation of items. This mod is mostly meant for game and mod authors as a starting point and/or example on how to use the `tt` mod. For a complete tooltip system, games still need to do the extra work and writing their texts themselves.","maintainers":["Wuzzy"],"media_license":"MIT","name":"tt_base","provides":["tt_base"],"release":29690,"repo":"https://codeberg.org/Wuzzy/minetest_tt_base","score":43.3,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/3235bdb0cc.png"],"short_description":"Adds generic tooltip extensions to items","state":"APPROVED","tags":["inventory"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/3235bdb0cc.png","title":"Extended Tooltips: Base","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/Wuzzy/tt_base/releases/29690/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"Wuzzy/tt":[],"Wuzzy/tt_base":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"tt","packages":["Wuzzy/mineclone2","Wuzzy/tt","VoxelForge/voxelforge","Wuzzy/lazarr","ryvnf/mineclonia","Wuzzy/hades_revisited","Casimir/voxelgarden","Wuzzy/repixture","EmptyStar/asuna"]}]},"hash":"0ai94zgz11a43zygwyqa4lhdq0icf6zg0ay2ykb9qsdfp8y1mc9b"}
