  "long_description": "Generates a stone platform at world origin or the static spawn point.\nIdeal to get started in the *singlenode* mapgen, but can be used in other mapgens as well.\n\nDefault size: 33×2×33. All stone, with a single cobblestone in the center.\nThe width can be changed with the `spawnbuilder_width` setting.\n\nBy default, the platform will be centered at (0,-1,0), but if the setting “`static_spawnpoint`” is present, the platform appears below that instead.\nAlso, 3 layers of air are generated above the platform, so it works in the underground, too.",
