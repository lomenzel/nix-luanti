  "long_description": "Repixture is a sandbox survival game focusing on nature, survival and primitive technologies. The world is random and features mostly a temperate climate. Explore the world and gather resources to survive. Craft tools and things to build with, build shelter and later the buildings of your dreams. What you do in this world is up to you: Go mining for the mysterious lumien, forge the mightiest sword, trade with villagers, go farming, upgrade your tools with jewels, hunt for achievements, or do more.\n\n## Gameplay\nThere is an official [Player Manual](https://wuzzy.codeberg.page/Repixture/).\n\nSummary: The first goal is to survive and build a shelter, later on you will explore the world and gather resources to improve your tools or craft simple building materials and decorations. The technology tree is rather low tech and as such, early progress is rather slow-paced. A few creatures will roam the world, most of them peaceful. Sometimes, you will encounter a village with traders.\n\n## Features\n* Nice, mostly lush biomes\n* Animals and monsters\n* Villages and trading\n* Upgradable tools via jeweling\n* Hunger\n* Armor\n* Simple crafting with crafting guide\n* A variety of trees\n* Weather\n* Beds (to skip the night)\n* Boats\n* Paint brush\n* New and better player models\n* Player skins\n* Achievements\n* Multi-language support\n* Creative Mode in which you can build freely",
