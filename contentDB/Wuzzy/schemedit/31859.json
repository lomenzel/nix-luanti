  "long_description": "This tool allows you to create, edit and save schematics.\n\nA schematic is a data structure in Luanti which contains data to place a pre-defined structure in the world, like trees or buildings.\n\nThis mod also supports the advanced schematic features such as per-node probabilities, force-placed nodes, and Y slice probabilities. \n\nServer commands: `placeschem` (place schematic), `mts2lua` (convert .mts to .lua file).\n\nThis mod is for modders and advanced users, the goal of this mod is to become the #1 schematic editing tool. If you don't understand anything of this, you should read the Luanti Lua API documentation on schematics.\n\nTo learn how to use this mod, see the [README.md](https://codeberg.org/Wuzzy/minetest_schemedit/src/branch/master/README.md) file.\n",
