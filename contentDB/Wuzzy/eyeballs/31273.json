  "long_description": "This is my submission for the 2024 Luanti Game Jam. Enjoy! :-)\n\nNote: This game is recommended for Luanti 5.12.0 or later. Older versions (from Luanti 5.10.0) still work, but have small bugs.\n\n## Plot\n\nAfter years of experimentation, the Cult of Oculon has finally managed to open the portal to the Realm of Eyes, where floating eyeballs, both good and evil, live.\n\nYou’re the Chosen One. You must venture deep into the Realm of Eyes to uncover its deepest secrets.\n\nThis realm is governed by one simple rule: The Unseen are lost. Only those who are seen by the eyeballs will be able to move on.\n\n## Objective / Gameplay\n\nYou start in the headquarters of the cult. Stand on the magic portal in the main hall to enter the Realm of Eyes. The eyeballs are your friends … well, most of them.\n\nFrom now on, you have to be seen by at least one friendly eyeball at all times. As long you are seen, you are safe. However, if not, then the Thing will snatch you!\n\nThe objective is to find and stand on the portal in each location.\n\n### On-screen indicators\n\nThe counter at the bottom of the screen shows how many eyeballs are seeing you right now.\n\nIf you’re not seen by the friendly eyeballs, a danger bar will appear that rapidly fills up. Once it’s full, you will be taken by the Thing and you have to try the level again.",
