  "long_description": "This mod adds a new tool: The point teleporter. It is a tool which allows for short-range teleportation. Punch any pointed node to teleport.\nRange is 20 block lengths.\n\nTo teleport, the destination needs to have enough space, there must be at least 1×2×1 nodes of passable space.\n\nPoint teleporters comes in up to three varieties, which only differ in how often you can use them and whether and which energy source they use:\n\n* Infinite point teleporter: You can use it without limits.\n* Magic point teleporter: It uses 20 mana per teleportation. (Only available if the `mana` mod is active)\n* Electronic point teleporter: It has to be charged at a battery station first. A charged one grants you about 50 teleportations. This point teleporter can be crafted. (Only available if the `technic` mod is active)\n",
