Game authors can use this to add small pieces of additional info to the item tooltip in a consistent manner. There's also support for automatically generating tooltip extensions.","maintainers":["Wuzzy"],"media_license":"MIT","name":"tt","provides":["tt"],"release":5069,"repo":"https://codeberg.org/Wuzzy/minetest_tt","score":342.3,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/d8tEVysjL5.png"],"short_description":"Support for custom tooltip extensions for items","state":"APPROVED","tags":["library"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/d8tEVysjL5.png","title":"Extended Tooltips","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/Wuzzy/tt/releases/5069/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"Wuzzy/tt":[]},"hash":"08zx33vip22pfa2r3s7wlywzzz4hszzgd6vpj27b8qihlqpc70gp"}
