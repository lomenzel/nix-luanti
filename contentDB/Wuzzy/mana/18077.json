  "long_description": "This mod adds basic support for mana.\n\nEach player will have an additional attribute: Mana. To be precise:\n\n* Current mana reserves: How much mana the player currently has\n* Maximum possible mana: How much mana the player can have at maximum\n* Mana regeneration amont: How much mana will be generated each “mana tick” (default 0.2 seconds)\n\nBy default, each player spawns with 0/200 mana, and regenerates 1 mana per fifth of a second. All these values can be configured with the server settings (`minetest.conf`) and it is highly advised to do so if you plan to integrate this mod into a game.\n\nThe mana regeneration rate (the “mana tick”) is a global setting and is *not* configured on a per-player basis.\n\nThe mod provides a simple API to set, get, add and subtract the mana (and maximum) mana of any player, and for setting the regeneration amount. Note that this mod itself does *not* change the gameplay in a meaningful way. You should install other mods which use the Mana mod as a dependency.\n\nThe API documentation is in the file `API.md`.\n\nIf the mod “HUD bars” [`hudbars`] is installed, a blue bar will be added to the HUD showing the player's mana reserves.\n\nOtherwise, the mana is just shown as text.",
