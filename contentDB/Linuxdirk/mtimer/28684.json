  "long_description": "### Abstract\n**mTimer** is a mod that allows players to individually configure and show a timer as permanent HUD element that automatically updates every second. The timer can show the real-world time and the ingame time as well as the current play session starting time and duration in freely configurable formats.\n\nUse it on your public server to give your players additional value (players can individually hide the timer if they want) while being on your server or use it in your singleplayer world to stay informed or – when creating creative content for others to watch – give your viewers a hint on when the footage was recorded.\n\n### Some More Details\nSince the Content Database does not allow external screenshots to be shown I cannot show any configuration examples here. Please check out the readme on GitLab for that.\n\nThe timer display and settings are entirely configured on a per-player basis via configuration formspecs. For opening the main menu simply enter the `/mtimer` chat command. From the main menu all configuration formspecs are accessible.\n\nSome formspecs allow you to use variables. The variables and their current (i.e. the moment when opening the formspec) values are shown below the input field.\n\nConfiguration formspecs can also be accessed directly by providing the respective parameter to the `/mtimer` chat command. Run `/mtimer help` to see a list of available parameters.\n\nAvailable languages are English (default), German, and Italian.",
