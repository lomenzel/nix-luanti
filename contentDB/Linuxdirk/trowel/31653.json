  "long_description": "_**Modify adjacent nodes with one click to build walls.**_\n\nWhen building larger structures in Luanti games with building focus you might find yourself in a situation where you might want to raise up a line of nodes to build some sort of wall.\n\nA trowel or brick trowel is a brick mason’s tool that is used for building walls – and this mod implements one, so you can build walls, too.\n\nThe mod respects creative/survival modes.\n\nFor in-depth information on the functionality of the registered tool, and configuration for servers and API usage, see the advanced configuration readme in the source repository.\n\nBy default the trowel can be obtained either by crafting or by invoking a chat command if there is not craft recipe being registered. This can be changed by games. If neither of the methods work in your game, check the game’s instructions.\n\nThe craft recipe shape is always the same. The needed items are depending on the game.\n\n```\n┏━━━┯━━━┯━━━┓\n┃   │ S │ H ┃\n┠───┼───┼───┨\n┃   │ S │   ┃\n┠───┼───┼───┨\n┃ P │ P │   ┃\n┗━━━┷━━━┷━━━┛\n```\n\n* P → plate\n* S → shaft\n* H → handle\n\nIt is always something *iron-y* for the plate, something *stick-y* for the shaft and something *handle-y* for the handle (either handle material like leather or something you could wrap around a stick to get a handle – like a string for example).\n\nIf the game has no craft recipe materials assigned (or the assigned materials are invalid) a chat command is registered instead. With this chat command you can obtain a trowel for free.\n\n```\n/trowel giveme\n```\n\nThe following games have a craft recipe registered. Consult your game’s craft recipes overview for details on what materials are needed.\n\n* Asuna\n* Mesecraft\n* Mineclonia\n* Minetest Game\n* VoxeLibre\n\nFeel free to suggest games to add (as well as the materials to use for the plate, the shaft, and the handle).",
