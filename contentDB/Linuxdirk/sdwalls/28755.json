The walls automatically connect to all other walls created by *SD Walls*.**\n\nIn addition to that wall pillars are automatically created where applicable.\n\n* At all corners\n* At all T-junctions\n* At all wall ends\n* If the wall stands alone\n* If the wall is surrounded by other walls\n\nIf a wall is not in one of the above positions nothing will happen to it and it remains as a wall.\n\nIf you want to use a pillar/wall where usually a wall/pillar would be placed just punch the wall while wielding a wall. The punched wall will then toggle between the pillar form and the wall form.\n\nPlease note: This toggled type will be updated according to the neighbors when placing a wall adjacent to the toggled wall and has to be re-set as wanted at no cost.\n\nCrafting walls from the *SD Walls* mod is similar to crafting the regular walls in *Minetest Game* except the top right node. An “uncrafting” recipe also exists.","maintainers":["Linuxdirk"],"media_license":"CC0-1.0","name":"sdwalls","provides":["sdwalls"],"release":28755,"repo":"https://git.0x7be.net/dirk/sdwalls","score":320.6,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/yMvbZ548Xu.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/678351f133.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/0a46a79b11.png"],"short_description":"Modular flexible walls for supported Luanti Games.","state":"APPROVED","tags":["building","decorative"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/yMvbZ548Xu.png","title":"Super Duper Walls!","translation_url":"https://translate.codeberg.org/projects/linuxdirks-luanti-mods/sdwalls/","type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/Linuxdirk/sdwalls/releases/28755/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"Linuxdirk/sdwalls":[]},"hash":"0gi4nfklhwd614rx3h5yp9syhdfl68mnvvd5q30p4fsl1xi681mg"}
