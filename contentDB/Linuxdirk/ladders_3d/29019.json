  "long_description": "### Crafting\n\nCrafting a ladder is done quite similar to crafting the default ladders. Instead of a stick the whole block is used. Just place in an `H` shape to get 7 ladders. To uncraft a ladder, just place it in the crafting grid to get one of the base block back.\n\nThe crafting recipe is more expensive than the de-facto standard recipe coming from “Minetest Game” `default` ladders. You get the materials back 1:1, though.\n\n### Configuration options\nListed below are the configuration options that can be set either in the configuration that was used for the server or in the file `_ladders_3d.conf` in the world directory. Configuration options are set in the following order.\n\n1. Built-in defaults\n2. Configuration options\n3. World-specific configuration options\n\nA `settingtypes.txt` for the advanced configuration GUI for the Luanti client exists, but this does only set the global configuration options. It is suggested to use world-specific configuration options only, though.\n\n```conf\n# For each supported mod as `modname`. Refer to the Lua files in `registry` to\n# get the currently supported mods.\nladders_3d_load_modname = true\n\n# Override “Minetest Game” default ladders to look 3D (this is considered as a\n# “hack” and only looks good with default textures for the ladders.)\nladders_3d_override_default_ladders = true\n\n# Use exact selection box when no custom selection box is set. This does\n# not apply to the overridden “Minetest Game” default ladders.\nladders_3d_exact_selection_box = false\n\n# Players can walk through ladders. This sets the `walkable` node value. It is\n# “reverse” of that the description is. If it is set to `false` players cannot\n# walk through ladders.\nladders_3d_walkable_by_default = false\n```\n\nThe listing above shows the default values. Please also refer to `settingtypes.txt` for a more in-detail description of the parameters. Individual registration files can introduce own configuration options. If the files are built-in the options should be noted in `settingtypes.txt`.",
