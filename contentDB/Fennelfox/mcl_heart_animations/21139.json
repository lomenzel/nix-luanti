  "long_description": "This mod takes a somewhat hacky approach to adding a shaking and flashing animation to the heart bar in Mineclone 2.\n\nExample:\n[Gif Link](https://i.ibb.co/nr1gfWn/demo4.gif)\n\nChangelog\n\n3.0 - Fixed and improved most of the code in the mod. Now it should actually work as well as adjusting for creative/survival mode. Also changed the hearts to flash three times for taking damage and twice for healing (actually like minecraft).\n\n2.1 - Fixed the background not flashing sometimes\n\n2.0b - Added a shaking animation when low on health (4 hp or less)\n\n1.1 - Changed the animation so that it flashes twice for damage but only once for healing. (More like Minecraft).\n\n1.0 - Added basic flashing animation",
