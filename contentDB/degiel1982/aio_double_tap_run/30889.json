  "long_description": "# **AIO - DOUBLE TAP RUN**\n\n### **Features List**\n- **Fatigue Bar**: Displays a fatigue bar when no stamina/hunger_ng/hbhunger mod is installed or if you're not in creative mode. This feature is toggleable in the settings.  \n- **Intuitive Double-Tap Sprinting**: Activate sprinting effortlessly by double-tapping the forward key for a natural and responsive way to boost movement speed.  \n- **Comprehensive Sprinting Mod**: Built with double-tap sprinting as the flagship feature, providing a refined sprinting experience suitable for all players.  \n- **Optional AUX1 Sprinting**: Enable sprinting via the AUX1 key for even more customizationâ€”or use both options.  \n- **Seamless Sprinting Experience**: Enjoy fluid, uninterrupted sprinting without unexpected stops or interruptions.  \n- **Enhanced Water Diving**: Sprint while fully submerged for faster underwater navigation.  \n- **Extensive Customization Options**: Customize the mod's settings to perfectly suit your playstyle.  \n- **Controller & Touchscreen Optimization**: Smooth movement using the D-pad or touchscreen.\n- **Stamina Integration**: Fully supports stamina mechanics from mods such as **stamina/hunger_ng/hbhunger** for an immersive gameplay experience.  \n- **Xcompat Sprint Particles**: Enjoy sprint particle effects with broader compatibility across supported worlds.  \n\n### How it works (WIP)\n\nIt is essentially a full fledged sprinting mod. \n\nIt has support for stamina/hunger_ng and hbhunger. \nWhen these mods are not installed it will default to my own custom made fatigue bar (You can turn it off in the settings).\nThe fatigue bar restores fatigue when a player is standing still/not sprinting for 2 seconds.\nWhen they are installed or the player is in creative the fatigue bar will hide.\n\nIt will sprint when a sprint key or double tap is detected and drain/restore fatigue/stamina/hunger when enabled in the settings.\nStamina by sofar is supported, but because of the limitations of the mod you must use their settings to change it.\nIf you want to disable the aux1 key in this mod you need to disable the sprint of the mod.\nYou can sprint under water when liquid cancelation is on. So it \"feels\" you are diving. \nIt supports hanggliding with extra speed but you need player_monoids or pova mod installed\n\n\n### **Great Mod Additions**\n1.  Enhance your experience with Don's **MyEyes Mod** to display the node you're looking at.\n2.  For an optimized experience, pair with the **3D Armor Fly Swim Mod**.\n3.  Slow down in **Mymonths (by Don)** snow covers.\n4. Animate the character with **Character Animations (by LMD) **\n5. **Hang Gliders (by mt-mods)** for smooth gliding in the air.\n6. **Stamina** by sofar \n7. **Stamina (Fork)** by TenPlus1\n8. **Hunger_NG** by Linuxdirk\n9. **HBHunger** by Wuzzy\n10. **Player Monoids**\n11. **Pova** by TenPlus1s\n12. **Hudbars** by Wuzzy\n\nYou can only use 1 of the stamina/hunger mods.\n\n",
