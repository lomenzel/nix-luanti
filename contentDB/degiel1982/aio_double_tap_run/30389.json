  "long_description": "# AIO - Double Tap Run\n\nThis mod adds a double-tap-to-run feature to Minetest, enhancing gameplay by providing a seamless way to toggle between walking and running. Whether you're exploring vast terrains or escaping danger, this mod ensures smooth and intuitive movement control.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Double-Tap Forward to Run**: Activate running mode by quickly double-tapping the forward movement key (`W`).\n- **Dynamic Animation Speed**: The player's animation speed dynamically adjusts based on their movement speed, providing a more immersive experience.\n- **Configurable Sprint Speed**: Customize the sprint speed using the `aio_dt.extra_speed` setting.\n- **Aux1 Key Support**: Optionally enable the Aux1 key for sprinting by setting `aio_dt.use_aux` to `true`.\n- **Automatic Integration with Stamina Mods**: If supported stamina mods (e.g., Sofar's or TenPlus1's stamina mods) are installed, the mod will automatically adjust sprinting behavior based on stamina levels.\n- **Pova Integration**: Automatically integrates with the Pova mod to manage sprinting physics overrides.\n- **Player Monoids Integration**: Uses Player Monoids to ensure compatibility with other mods that modify player physics.\n- **Liquid Interaction**: Automatically disables sprinting when the player is in liquid, ensuring realistic movement.\n- **Ladder Interaction**: Sprinting is disabled when the player is on a ladder unless explicitly enabled via configuration.\n- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Designed to integrate seamlessly with Minetest without impacting performance.\n- **No Required Dependencies**: This mod works out of the box without requiring any additional mods.\n- **API Support**: Provides an API for developers to enable or disable sprinting programmatically.\n\n## How to Use\n\n- **Double-Tap to Sprint**: Quickly press the forward movement key (`W`) twice to activate sprinting mode. Sprinting will increase your movement speed.\n- **Stop Sprinting**:\n   Release the forward key (`W`) to stop sprinting.\n- **Enable Aux1 Key for Sprinting**:\n   Set `aio_dt.use_aux` to `true` in your `minetest.conf` file to enable the Aux1 key for sprinting.\n-  **Stamina Integration**:\n   If Sofar's or TenPlus1's stamina mods are installed, stamina will drain while sprinting and regenerate when walking or standing still.\n   - **Important**: When using a stamina mod, adjust the sprint speed and exhaustion settings in the stamina mod's configuration to ensure proper integration.\n- **Pova Integration**:\n   If the Pova mod is installed, it will be used to manage sprinting physics overrides, ensuring compatibility with other mods that modify player physics.\n- **Player Monoids Integration**:\n   If the Player Monoids mod is installed, it will be used to manage sprinting physics overrides, ensuring compatibility with other mods that modify player physics.\n- **Ladder Behavior**:\n   By default, sprinting is disabled when the player is on a ladder. You can enable sprinting on ladders by setting `aio_dt.ladder_sprint` to `true` in your `minetest.conf`.\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou can customize the mod's behavior using the following settings in your `minetest.conf` file. These settings should only be adjusted if no stamina mod is installed. If a stamina mod is present, use its configuration settings for sprinting behavior.\n\n- `aio_dt.extra_speed` (default: `0.5`): Sets the additional speed multiplier for sprinting. For example, setting it to `0.5` will make sprinting 50% faster than walking.\n- `aio_dt.use_aux` (default: `false`): Enables the Aux1 key for sprinting when set to `true`.\n- `aio_dt.ladder_sprint` (default: `false`): Enables sprinting while on ladders when set to `true`.\n\n### Example Configuration\n```plaintext\naio_dt.extra_speed = 0.7\naio_dt.use_aux = true\naio_dt.ladder_sprint = false\n```\n\n## API\n\nThe mod includes a simple API for developers to integrate sprinting functionality into their own mods:\n\n- `aio_double_tap_run.set_sprinting(player, state)`\n  - Enables or disables sprinting for a specific player.\n  - **Parameters**:\n    - `player`: The player object.\n    - `state`: Boolean value (`true` to enable sprinting, `false` to disable`).\n\n### Example Usage\n```lua\nlocal player = minetest.get_player_by_name(\"player_name\")\nif player then\n    -- Enable sprinting for the player\n    aio_double_tap_run.set_sprinting(player, true)\n\n    -- Disable sprinting for the player\n    aio_double_tap_run.set_sprinting(player, false)\nend\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### None\nThis mod does not require any dependencies and works out of the box.\n\n### Optional:\n- [Sofar's Stamina Mod](https://content.luanti.org/packages/sofar/stamina/?protocol_version=47): Automatically adjusts sprinting behavior based on stamina levels.\n- [TenPlus1's Stamina Mod](https://content.luanti.org/packages/TenPlus1/stamina/?protocol_version=47): Supports stamina exhaustion while sprinting.\n- [Player Monoids](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Byakuren/player_monoids/?protocol_version=47): Ensures compatibility with other mods that modify player physics.\n- [Pova](https://content.luanti.org/packages/TenPlus1/pova/): Manages sprinting physics overrides for compatibility with other mods.\n\n## License\n\n- **Code**: MIT License\n- **Media**: No media included\n\nEnjoy the enhanced movement mechanics with this mod!",
