  "long_description": "A layout manager and formspec API replacement.\nVaguely inspired by Flutter and GTK.\n\n[Online tutorial/demo](https://luk3yx.gitlab.io/minetest-flow-playground/)\n([source](https://gitlab.com/luk3yx/minetest-flow-playground))\n\n## Features\n\n#### Layouting\n\n - No manual positioning of elements.\n - Automatic layouting using `HBox` and `VBox` containers\n - Some elements have an automatic size.\n - The size of elements can optionally expand to fit larger spaces\n - Elements which get their size based on their label length automatically become larger/smaller to fit long translations.\n\n#### Other features\n\n - No form names. Form names are still used internally, however they are\n   hidden from the API.\n - No having to worry about state.\n - Values of fields, scrollbars, checkboxes, etc are remembered when\n   redrawing a form and are automatically applied.\n - Has an [inspector mod](https://content.luanti.org/packages/luk3yx/flow_inspector/)\n   to help with developing and debugging forms.\n - Some common security issues with formspec input handling are mitigated.\n\n## Limitations\n\n - This mod doesn't support all of the features that regular formspecs do.\n - [FS51](https://content.luanti.org/packages/luk3yx/fs51/) is required if\n   you want to have full support for Minetest 5.3 and below.\n - Make sure you're using the latest version of flow if you are on MT 5.10-dev or later, older versions used a hack which no longer works.\n\n## Basic example\n\nSee `example.lua` for a more comprehensive example which demonstrates how\nlayouting and alignment works.\n\n```lua\n-- GUI elements are accessible with flow.widgets. Using\n-- `local gui = flow.widgets` is recommended to reduce typing.\nlocal gui = flow.widgets\n\n-- GUIs are created with flow.make_gui(build_func).\nlocal my_gui = flow.make_gui(function(player, ctx)\n    -- The build function should return a GUI element such as gui.VBox.\n    -- `ctx` can be used to store context. `ctx.form` is reserved for storing\n    -- the state of elements in the form. For example, you can use\n    -- `ctx.form.my_checkbox` to check whether `my_checkbox` is checked. Note\n    -- that ctx.form.element may be nil instead of its default value.\n\n    -- This function may be called at any time by flow.\n\n    -- gui.VBox is a \"container element\" added by this mod.\n    return gui.VBox {\n        gui.Label {label = \"Here is a dropdown:\"},\n        gui.Dropdown {\n            -- The value of this dropdown will be accessible from ctx.form.my_dropdown\n            name = \"my_dropdown\",\n            items = {'First item', 'Second item', 'Third item'},\n            index_event = true,\n        },\n        gui.Button {\n            label = \"Get dropdown index\",\n            on_event = function(player, ctx)\n                -- flow should guarantee that `ctx.form.my_dropdown` exists, even if the client doesn't send my_dropdown to the server.\n                local selected_idx = ctx.form.my_dropdown\n                core.chat_send_player(player:get_player_name(), \"You have selected item #\" .. selected_idx .. \"!\")\n            end,\n        }\n    }\nend)\n\n-- Show the GUI to player as an interactive form\n-- Note that `player` is a player object and not a player name.\nmy_gui:show(player)\n\n-- Close the form\nmy_gui:close(player)\n\n-- Alternatively, the GUI can be shown as a non-interactive HUD (requires\n-- hud_fs to be installed).\nmy_gui:show_hud(player)\nmy_gui:close_hud(player)\n```\n\n## Other formspec libraries/utilities\n\nThese utilities likely aren't compatible with flow.\n\n - [fs_layout](https://github.com/fluxionary/minetest-fs_layout/) is another mod library that does automatic formspec element positioning.\n - [fslib](https://content.luanti.org/packages/LMD/fslib/) is a small mod library that lets you build formspec strings.\n - [Just_Visiting's formspec editor](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Just_Visiting/formspec_editor) is a Luanti (formerly Minetest) game (formerly subgame) that lets you edit formspecs and preview them as you go\n - [kuto](https://github.com/TerraQuest-Studios/kuto/) is a formspec library that has some extra widgets/components and has a callback API. Some automatic sizing can be done for buttons. It may be possible to use kuto's components with flow somehow as they both use formspec_ast internally.\n - [My web-based formspec editor](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=24130) lets you add elements and drag+drop them, however it doesn't support all formspec features.\n\n## Elements\n\nSee the README file on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/luk3yx/minetest-flow#elements) or\n[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/luk3yx/minetest-flow#elements) for more\ndocumentation.",
