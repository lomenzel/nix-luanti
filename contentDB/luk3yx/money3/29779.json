  "long_description": "This is a fork of [money2](https://github.com/Bremaweb/money2) that uses more\nmodern APIs such as mod storage and is fully backwards compatible with\n`money2` (you can upgrade from money2 nicely, however you can't downgrade\nagain).\n\n## Before installing\n\nBy default, players can convert gold and silver ingots into money using\n`/convert gold` and `/convert silver`. To disable this, add\n`money3.convert_items = nil` to minetest.conf.\n\nPlayers need the \"money\" privilege to be able to use /money and receive\npayments. You should consider adding `money` to the default_privs setting in\nminetest.conf.\n\n## Config settings\n\n*These can be set in `config.lua` or `minetest.conf`.*\n\n - `money3.initial_amount`: The amount of money new players get. Default: `0`.\n - `money3.currency_name`: The text appended to the currency when displaying it.\n    Default: `cr`.\n - `money3.enable_income`: Pays players money (by default 10cr) every in-game\n    day. Default: `true` if creative mode is disabled, otherwise `false`. If\n    you are using the [currency](https://content.minetest.net/packages/mt-mods/currency/)\n    mod, it is probably a good idea to set `currency.income_enabled` to `false`.\n - `money3.income_amount`: Changes the amount of income players get paid. If\n    income is not enabled, this does nothing.\n - `money3.convert_items`: A lua table (that can also be `nil` to disable)\n    similar to the following (default) one:\n\n```lua\n{\n    gold = { item = \"default:gold_ingot\", dig_block=\"default:stone_with_gold\",\n        desc='Gold', amount=75, minval=25 },\n    silver = { item = \"moreores:silver_ingot\",\n        dig_block=\"moreores:mineral_silver\", desc='Silver', amount = 27,\n        minval=7}\n}\n```\n\n## unified_money backend\n\nIf [unified_money](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Emojiminetest/unified_money/)\n(more specifically `um_plugin_playername`) is installed, money3 will register\nitself as a unified_money backend. This means that any mods using the\nunified_money frontend API will be able to work with money3 without any\nadditional effort.",
