  "long_description": "A subset of SQL for Luanti (formerly known as Minetest). No complex installation required.\n\n## Goals\n\n - No additional installation steps (mod security, external libraries, etc)\n - Reasonable performance for small-ish databases\n - The ability to use both Squill (for singleplayer and smaller servers) and SQLite (for large servers which go out of their way to set it up) without too much special code.\n - No hard limit on the amount of data stored (unlike `core.serialize()`), although storing a lot of data will be slow.\n - Faster startup time than running `core.parse_json()` on a giant file.\n\n## Non-goals\n\n - Implement every SQL feature\n - Scalability - if you have very large tables, expect high memory usage and\n   low performance.\n\n## Documentation\n\nSee [the README](https://codeberg.org/luk3yx/minetest-squill#readme) for the rest of the documentation.",
