  "long_description": "A mod that allows players to be put in stasis.\n\n## Putting yourself in stasis\n\nYou only need the `interact` privilege to use a stasis chamber.\n\nTo put yourself in a stasis chamber, simply stand still and right-click it.\n  To leave the stasis chamber, right-click it again, or run `/uncloak` if you\n  do not have `interact`.\n\nWhile in stasis, movement is disabled and you are cloaked.\n\n## Putting someone else in stasis\n\nIf you have the [knockout](https://github.com/Billy-S/knockout) mod installed,\n  you can put other players in stasis.\n\nPick up a knocked out player, carry the player to the stasis chamber,\n  (do *not* jump while holding the player), and right-click the chamber.\n\nRemember that players inside a stasis chamber can leave at any time, and cannot\n  be forcibly held there (except with patience and help from the knockout mod).\n\n## Transporting stasis chambers through pipeworks\n\nStasis chambers can also function as a makeshift transportation system with the\n  help of pipeworks (or similar). This has an advantage over mods that use\n  teleportation in survival-based worlds because you need a nonbroken tube\n  between destinations, and travelling takes time.\n\nTo transport a stasis chamber containing a player, you can use node breakers\n  (or an equivalent) at one end, and a deployer (or equivalent) at the other.\n  If you do not want automation, you may simply pick up an active stasis chamber\n  and place it down at the destination, the player it contains will move with it\n  (unless they decided to leave).\n\nWhile in transit, players are shown a formspec with an option to leave, that\n  teleports the player back to the original location of the stasis chamber.\n\n## Crafting\n\nCrafting recipes are added in version 2018-07-26.\n\n### Stasis chamber Mk1\n\nSingle-use, requires one glass bottle per use.\n\n![Crafting recipe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luk3yx/minetest-stasis/master/chamber%20mk1.png)\n\n### Stasis chamber Mk2\n\nMultiple uses, requires one mese crystal fragment per use.\n\n![Crafting recipe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luk3yx/minetest-stasis/master/chamber%20mk2.png)\n\n### Stasis chamber Mk3\n\nMultiple uses, no additional items required.\n\n![Crafting recipe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luk3yx/minetest-stasis/master/chamber%20mk3.png)\n\n## TODO\n\n- Better player texture.\n- Bugfixes.",
