One blueprint\ncan only store one node, if you want to bulk save/load/copy/move nodes, see\n[WorldEdit](https://github.com/Uberi/Minetest-WorldEdit).\n\n## Items\n\nBlueprints introduces two types of items: Blank blueprints, and... well...\nnon-blank blueprints.\n\nBlank blueprint crafting:\n\nRequires:\n - 8 `basic_materials` plastic strips\n - 1 paper sheet\n\nTo erase data off a blueprint, provided it isn't already blank, put it in the\ncrafting grid.\n\n## Usage instructions\n\nBlueprints are relatively intuitive to use. To take a blueprint of something,\nsimply left-click it while holding a blank blueprint. To apply the blueprint\nto other nodes, you can left-click the node. **Do not apply blueprints to chests\nor other nodes with items in, you will lose your items.** To place a new node\ndown with the blueprint applied, just right-click while holding the blueprint.\nNote that with pipeworks and mesecons placing a node with a blueprint will not\nlink up wires/pipes to the node.\n\n## What can/can't be blueprinted?\n\nBy default, item metadata (such as node settings) is saved, however, of course,\nnode inventories aren't. This can be overridden on a per-item basis (for more\ninformation, see the [API] page). Unless overridden by mods, nodes not in the\ncreative inventory cannot be blueprinted.\n\nBecause of the way pipeworks teleportation tubes work, they cannot be\nblueprinted.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nBlueprints has no mandatory dependencies, however blueprints will be uncraftable\nwithout `basic_materials` and `default`.\n\nThe following dependencies are so blueprint rules can be added onto items for\nbetter compatibility:\n - `mesecons`\n   - `mesecons_fpga`\n   - `mesecons_microcontroller`\n   - `mesecons_luacontroller`\n - `pipeworks`\n\n## License\n\nThe whole mod, including textures, are licensed under the [MIT license].\n\n## API\n\nMod developers can restrict what can/can't be blueprinted with the [API].\n\n[API]:         https://gitlab.com/luk3yx/minetest-blueprints/raw/master/API.md\n[MIT license]: https://gitlab.com/luk3yx/minetest-blueprints/raw/master/LICENSE.md\n","maintainers":["luk3yx"],"media_license":"MIT","name":"blueprints","provides":["blueprints"],"release":5749,"repo":"https://gitlab.com/luk3yx/minetest-blueprints","score":3.9,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/5NW8nuN0jz.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/8s32e3munS.png"],"short_description":"Allows Minetest players to easily copy+paste nodes.","state":"APPROVED","tags":["survival","tools"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/5NW8nuN0jz.png","title":"Blueprints","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/luk3yx/blueprints/releases/5749/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"luk3yx/blueprints":[]},"hash":"0yakislfwg8w6h12r9h5pbl5m99mfff2kdi788djmaj1r0v24476"}
