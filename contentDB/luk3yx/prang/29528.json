  "long_description": "# PRANG!\n\nAn unofficial port of\n[PRANG!](https://atomicshrimp.com/post/2020/01/10/Play-PRANG!) to Minetest.\n\nThere are instructions on how to play inside the game. In short, you have to\ncollect food/potions and avoid enemies. You can get a powerup (umbrella) to be\nable to destroy enemies, however obstacles are deadly while you have the\npowerup.\n\nRequires 5.4.0+ servers, however it should work with clients down to 5.0.0 (although it will send more HUD updates to clients older than 5.2.0).\n\nOn MT 5.6.1 and older, you may need to zoom out to be able to see the entire game on smaller displays.\n\n## Public server\n\nIf you don't want to download PRANG!, Edgy1 hosts a public server on `prang.edgy1.net` port `30003`. Note that movement processing and rendering is done server-side so there may be lag and/or glitching if you are far away from the server (which is currently in Germany) or have a poor internet connection.\n\n## License\n\n### Code\n\n`formspec_ast`, `fs51`, `hud_fs`, and `prang` are all MIT.\n\n### Media\n\nThe textures are CC BY-SA 4.0\n[Atomic Shrimp(?)](https://atomicshrimp.com/post/2020/01/10/Play-PRANG%21), and\nthe music is CC BY-SA 3.0\n[Ozzed](https://ozzed.net/music/dunes-at-night.shtml).\n\nSee [the LICENSE.md file](https://gitlab.com/luk3yx/minetest-prang/-/blob/main/mods/prang/LICENSE.md) for more information.\n\n![Credits image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luk3yx/minetest-prang/main/mods/prang/textures/prang_credits_bg.jpg)",
