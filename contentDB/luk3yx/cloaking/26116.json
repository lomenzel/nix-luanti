  "long_description": "**NOTE:** The screenshot is for demonstration purposes only, there are no semi-transparent players/objects in this mod, as cloaked players are fully transparent.\n\n## What is cloaking?\n\nIn this instance, cloaking is a way to go invisible and become undetectable by\nmost mods (unless they explicitly want to detect cloaked players, so they can\nstill send chat messages to them).\n\n## Why is cloaking so hacky?\n\nThe aim of cloaking is to trick other mods into thinking the player is not\nin-game, and a lot of hacks are used to do this.\n\n## Help, it crashes\n\nIf it crashes, it is either caused by a mod not liking non-existent players\nrunning around, or by a bug in cloaking itself.\n\n## How do I use cloaking?\n\nCloaking adds a modding API and some chatcommands. All of the chatcommands\nrequire the \"cloaking\" privilege to execute, with the exception of `/uncloak`\nwhen used on yourself.\n\n- `/cloak [victim]`: Cloaks yourself, alternatively an unsuspecting `victim`.\n- `/uncloak [victim]`: Uncloaks yourself, or a `victim`.\n- `/cloak_chat <message>`: Sends `<message>` to all online players with the\n    `cloaking` privilege.\n    - You can disable cloaked chat by adding\n      `cloaking.enable_cloaked_chat = false` to minetest.conf.\n- `/shadow [victim]`: Attaches you to a player. If `victim` is not specified,\n    this command will detach you instead.\n    - Requires both the \"cloaking\" and \"teleport\" privileges.\n    - This command can only be used while cloaked.\n    - You can disable this by adding `cloaking.enable_shadow = false` to\n      minetest.conf.\n\n## How do I download cloaking?\n\nYou can either run\n`git clone https://git.minetest.land/luk3yx/cloaking.git` or download this mod\nfrom [ContentDB](https://content.luanti.org/packages/luk3yx/cloaking).\n\n## How do I use the API?\n\nCloaking adds the following functions:\n\n- `cloaking.cloak(player)`: Cloaks a player.\n- `cloaking.uncloak(player)`: Uncloaks a player.\n- `cloaking.get_cloaked_players()`: Gets a list of cloaked player names.\n- `cloaking.get_connected_names()`: Gets a list of cloaked and uncloaked player\n    names.\n- `cloaking.is_cloaked(player)`: Checks if a player is cloaked.\n- `cloaking.hide_player(player)`: Hides a player without cloaking them.\n- `cloaking.unhide_player(player)`: Unhides a player previously hidden with\n    `cloaking.hide_player()`.\n- `cloaking.chat`: Cloaked chat API, this is `nil` if cloaked chat is disabled.\n  - `cloaking.chat.send(message)`: Sends a message to cloaked chat.\n  - `cloaking.chat.prefix`: The text (`-Cloaked-`) that is prepended to cloaked\n    chat messages before they are sent to players.\n\n*Any above functions requiring \"player\" as a parameter also accept a player name, provided the player is online.*\n\nIt also adds the following functions that ignore cloaked players and can\ninteract with them:\n`cloaking.get_connected_players`, `cloaking.get_objects_inside_radius` and\n`cloaking.get_player_by_name`.\n\nIf you have made chatcommand work with players that aren't in-game, you can add\n`_allow_while_cloaked = true` to the chatcommand definition. If you explicitly\ndon't want your chatcommand working with cloaked players, you can add\n`_disallow_while_cloaked = true` to the definition.\nThese modifications do not require that you add cloaking as a dependency, as\nwhen cloaking is not loaded this parameter is simply ignored.\n\n## Backported bugfixes\n\nTo ensure server stability, the cloaking mod backports the following bugfixes\nif it determines they are necessary for your server:\n\n - Blocking newlines in chat messages (MT < 5.0.1).\n - Prevent saying `%2` in chat from crashing the server (MT == 5.1.0).\n - Prevent hacked clients from being able to access the inventories of other\n    players (MT < 5.4.0). *Note that this fix currently needs testing and\n    does not work on MT 0.4.*\n\nIf you do not want this for whatever reason (although I do not recommend it),\nyou can disable these backports by adding `cloaking.backport_bugfixes = false`\nto your minetest.conf.\n",
