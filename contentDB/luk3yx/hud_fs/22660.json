Depends on\n[formspec_ast](https://content.minetest.net/packages/luk3yx/formspec_ast/).\n\n## API\n\n - `hud_fs.show_hud(player, formname, formspec)`: Displays or updates a HUD\n    with the specified formname and formspec.\n    - `formspec` can also be a formspec_ast tree for more advanced usage.\n - `hud_fs.close_hud(player, formname)`: Closes `formname`. Equivalent to\n    `hud_fs.show_hud(player, formname, \"\")`.\n\nThe player parameter in the above function can either be a player object or a\nplayer name.\n\n*If you just want to manage HUDs, that's all you need to know!* Don't worry\nabout trying to get incremental updates or tracking HUD IDs, `hud_fs` does that\nfor you behind-the-scenes.\n\n### Supported formspec features\n\nAll formspecs are assumed to be version 3 and the `formspec_version` element\n(if any) is ignored.\n\nThe following elements are supported:\n\n - `size`\n    - While there is no background for the HUD, this does change where the\n      co-ordinates start from.\n - `position`, `anchor`\n    - **You need to use these to set the position of the HUD!**\n    - See [the Minetest API documentation](https://minetest.gitlab.io/minetest/formspec/#positionxy) for more info.\n    - You probably want `anchor` to have the same value as `position`.\n - `padding`\n    - When set, hud_fs attempts to calculate the form size in the same way that\n      the client does.\n    - Use `padding[0.05,0.05]` to make the HUD use roughly the same scaling as formspecs.\n - `container`\n - `label`\n    - Because of HUD limitations, `minetest.colorize()` only works at the start\n      of the label.\n - `image`\n - `box`\n - `textarea`\n    - If the name is non-empty a background is drawn behind the text.\n    - Text will overflow vertically outside the specified height.\n - `item_image`\n    - Only works with some nodes, should work with all craftitems.\n - `button`, `button_exit`, `image_button`, `image_button_exit`,\n   `item_image_button`\n    - Buttons become a grey box with a label in the middle.\n    - The label has the same limitations as the `label` element.\n    - The `noclip` option is ignored.\n    - Item image buttons have the same limitations as `item_image`.\n - `style`\n\nAll valid formspec elements not listed above are ignored.\n\n### Using normal HUD element definitions\n\nIf you want features can't be implemented using formspecs, you can use a list\nof HUD elements (the tables sent to `hud_add`) instead. Example:\n\n```lua\nhud_fs.show_hud(player, \"waypoints\", {\n    {\n        type = \"waypoint\",\n        world_pos = {x = 0, y = 0, z = 0},\n        name = \"Waypoint 1\"\n    },\n    {\n        type = \"waypoint\",\n        world_pos = {x = 1, y = 2, z = 3},\n        name = \"Waypoint 2\"\n    }\n})\n```\n\nThe \"type\" field shown above is introduced in MT 5.9-dev. hud_fs will\nautomatically convert this to hud_elem_type on older servers.\n\n### Advanced API\n\n - `hud_fs.set_scale(formname, scale)`: Sets the scale of the HUD.\n    - All future HUDs shown with `formname` will use this scale instead of the\n      default (64, subject to change).\n    - The scale is the amount of pixels per co-ordinate. For example, a 1x1\n      image will have a size of 10x10 pixels if the scale is set to 10.\n    - This is ignored on MT 5.7.0+ clients if a `padding[]` element exists in\n      the formspec.\n - `hud_fs.set_z_index(formname, z_index)`: Sets the base Z-Index of the HUD.\n    - All future HUDs shown with `formname` will use this z-index instead of\n      the default (0).\n    - The HUD will use z-index values from `z_index` to\n        `z_index + amount_of_hud_elements`.\n    - This won't work properly with Minetest clients older than 5.2.0.\n\n\n## FAQ(?)\n\n#### Why not implement this mod in the Minetest engine?\n\nThis mod (or anything similar) won't be implemented, a proposal to do so was\nrejected in https://github.com/minetest/minetest/issues/10135.\n\n#### Why formspecs?\n\n - There isn't a complicated new API to learn, if you write MT mods you\n   probably know how to use formspecs already.\n - I have a [web-based formspec editor] which can now be used to design HUDs\n   for use with this mod.\n - You don't need any knowledge of Minetest's HUD API to use this mod.\n - As this mod parses formspecs server-side, the lack of differential updates\n   is for the most part a non-issue.\n\n[web-based formspec editor]: https://git.minetest.land/luk3yx/formspec-editor\n\n#### But I hate formspecs and don't want to touch them\n\nThe API provided by this mod accepts a list of HUD elements in place of a\nformspec. Alternatively, there are other HUD library mods around such\nas [hudlib](https://github.com/octacian/hudlib) and\n[panel_lib](https://gitlab.com/zughy-friends-minetest/panel_lib).\n\n\n## Performance\n\nIf this mod becomes a performance bottleneck you can try the following things:\n\n - Move any formspec elements that are added or removed frequently to the end\n   of the formspec. This will allow them to be removed without touching other\n   elements internally.\n    - This mod is currently inefficient at updating HUDs when elements are\n      added or removed when they aren't at the end of the formspec.\n - Using a formspec_ast tree instead of a formspec in show_hud. `formspec_ast`\n   is relatively slow at parsing formspecs at the time of writing.\n - Don't call show_hud when you already know that nothing has changed. Doing so\n   will waste time parsing the formspec, converting it to HUD elements, then\n   figuring out what has changed.","maintainers":["luk3yx"],"media_license":"MIT","name":"hud_fs","provides":["hud_fs"],"release":22660,"repo":"https://gitlab.com/luk3yx/minetest-hud_fs","score":8.3,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/2681e76de2.png"],"short_description":"A library to make HUDs from formspecs","state":"APPROVED","tags":["hud","library"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/2681e76de2.png","title":"HUD FS","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/luk3yx/hud_fs/releases/22660/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"luk3yx/formspec_ast":[],"luk3yx/hud_fs":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"formspec_ast","packages":["luk3yx/prang","RedundantC/wis_part1","luk3yx/formspec_ast","Kimapr/nonsensical_skyblock","Thunder1035/pacman"]}]},"hash":"09bl0i9qc5m8i5mni5f6wzxgy1yic28x5s4mszgq4vspgphpx1gl"}
