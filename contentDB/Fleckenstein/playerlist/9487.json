(E.g. Display admins at the top of the list and make their name red). There is also a ping bar for every player (<= 20ms -> 4, <= 40ms -> 3, <= 60ms -> 2, > 60ms -> 1).\n\nThe playerlist key can be configured by changing the playerlist_key setting. Possible values are up, down, left, right, jump, aux1, sneak, dig, place or zoom.",
