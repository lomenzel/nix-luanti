  "long_description": "A classic game for Luanti, to explore, survive and build.\n\nCompatible with most mods for Minetest Game.\n\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\nOpen your inventory and take a look at the **Recipes** tab. Select items to see\nhow they can be made and select them twice to see what can be made out of them.\n\nThe primary resource needed to progress is crumbled stone. Combine 4 of them to\nmake cobblestone, which is the material for stone tools.\n\nTo get sticks, place 3 leaves vertically on the crafting grid. Besides tools and\ntorches, sticks are also used to make campfires, a cheap early-game replacement\nfor cobblestone furnaces.\n\nDepending on the biome, it might be harder or easier to find food. Usually, the\neasier and faster method to get food is to hunt rats. After killing one, it can\nbe cooked in a furnace or on a campfire to make some nutritious rat meat.\n\nThe base game mechanics aren't too difficult to get used to. The progression\nis fairly obvious from this point onwards. Follow the recipes. Alloy new metals.\nGo to the Nether.\n\n_Build a house. Plant a tree. Raise a rat._\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* \"Retro\" 2D mobs, inspired by Minetest 0.3.\n* Good textures by default, forming an overall consistent style.\n* Game mechanics different from Minetest Game and Minecraft, giving the game its\n  unique feeling.\n* Self-planting saplings. No need to collect them. Forests will spread\n  naturally.\n* Biome-dependent weather cycle, with rain extinguishing fire and snow piling on\n  the ground.\n* Progressive gameplay, while still offering different ways to achieve your\n  goals.\n* Coal-powered alloy furnaces making ingots that are unobtainable through\n  regular cooking or crafting.\n* More realistic metal progression. Iron lumps make iron ingots; alloy iron with\n  coal to make steel.\n* Hellish Nether realm, separated from the regular world by an unbreakable\n  bedrock layer.\n* Nether and Floatlands (v7) portals, ignited with the Realm Striker, an item\n  found within dungeons deep underground.\n* Not only stairs and slabs, but a wide range of sub-nodes, enabling detailed\n  buildings.\n* Most items can be placed down, allowing for interesting decorative elements.\n* Dyes can be placed on wool and similar nodes to instantly color them.\n* Must-see mapgen. Getting the best out of mapgens v6 and v7.\n* MC-like hunger and healing.\n* Sprinting mechanics.\n* Simple score system, motivating players to not abandon their worlds.\n* Modular doors, with which you can build more than just doors, e.g. window\n  frames, hatches, street lamps...\n* Cactus has spikes and they hurt.\n* Details, details, details. Don't miss them.",
