The default is 1 line limited to 40 characters, but it can be configured to split the message into multiple lines with the character limit applying per-line. (see screenshot for example)\n\nThe settings can be configured in `minetest.conf`,  as defined in the mod's `settingtypes.txt` :\n```\nmessage_bubbles_lifetime (Lifetime for message bubbles, in seconds) int 10 1 600\nmessage_bubbles_char_limit (Max number of characters to display per line of message bubble) int 40 5 500\nmessage_bubbles_max_num_lines (Max number of lines to display in a message bubble) int 1 1 10\nmessage_bubbles_prefix (Prefix to show before user message bubble) string Says: \n```\n\n## Compatibilty\nThis mod attempts to be compatible with other mods that modify the nametag by simply appending to existing nametag text, if it exists - however this is still WIP and needs testing. As of Release 0.5, the mod has been tested with the `better_nametags` mod, and now works with it.\n\n## Changelog\n- 1.0: Released mod, updated screenshot\n- 0.5: Fixed compatibility issues with other nametag mods; fixed issue with special escape characters that caused message to stay forever\n- 0.4: Added multiline message bubble support","maintainers":["ZenonSeth"],"media_license":"CC-BY-SA-3.0","name":"message_bubbles","provides":["message_bubbles"],"release":24207,"repo":"https://github.com/ZenonSeth/message_bubbles","score":313.7,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/b9dc217aa6.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/9e078ac3ab.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/2910b3ecc7.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/4367a4accb.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/951af98556.png"],"short_description":"Shows chat messages above player heads","state":"APPROVED","tags":["chat"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/b9dc217aa6.png","title":"Message Bubbles","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/ZenonSeth/message_bubbles/releases/24207/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"ZenonSeth/message_bubbles":[]},"hash":"0ll4dlf4wmdwnym19zyrjhsc6svbazg57nml68mp8zwlfr643dj1"}
