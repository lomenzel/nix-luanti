  "long_description": "# Splooshy Bombs API\n\nExplosions that fling debris!\n\nThis is largely a proof of concept. This mod provides a simple boom function for creating explosions, and a testing stick that can be used to cause explosions.\n\nWarning: The API might be changed\n\nThis mod is not very performant with large explosions, use vaporize and a higher drop_percent for larger explosions to avoid excessive entities.\n\ndrop_percent: Controls percentage of nodes at the very edge of the explosion that will be broken instead of flung (this is not the overall percentage!). Ex. 0 flings all of the blocks in the radius, 100 will break all of them.\n\nrespect_protection: If true, explosions will respect protection rules (untested)\n\nvaporize: If true, conservation of matter is ignored, and non-flung blocks will be deleted instead of dropped.\n\nSee init.lua for usage",
