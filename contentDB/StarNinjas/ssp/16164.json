  "long_description": "***NOTE: This game is very incomplete. Expect more features in the future.***\nImagine being alone. In a spacecraft. This is you.\n\nAfter a terrible accident, that has caused an outbreak of mutant spider in the SSP spacecraft; you awake out of your unconscious state that was caused by a spider bite; and you quickly realize you're the only one left in the SSP. All your crewmates are gone. Did the die? Did they abandon you? How could have they possibly disappeared?\nAs loneliness seeps in, and your will to survive diminishes, you must press on, and keep completing the \"Incase of Emergency\" tasks (found in your inventory). Maybe, once you have completed these tasks, and set course to earth, you will find ouy the truth about what happened to your crewmates.\n\nYou only have 1 life in this game, turn on creative mode for infinite respawns.\n\nThis is game is not only fun and a bit scary to play, but it teaches the importance of not being alone, and the necesity of friends, family, co-workers, and a good relationship with the God who created this world (\"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" John 3:16).\n\nHave fun!",
