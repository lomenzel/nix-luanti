  "long_description": "Allows players to send a request to other players to teleport to them. Includes many more teleporting features.\n\n## Privileges\n\nEach command needs a privilege. These are the following privileges:\n\n- `tp` is required in order to use all commands.\n- `tp_tpc` is required in order to use `/tpc`.\n- `tp_tpc` is required in order to use `/tpe`.\n- `tp_tpc` is required in order to use `/tpj`.\n- `interact` is required to use all commands.\n- `tp_admin` gives more control to admins:\n\n  - Admins can teleport to players even when they haven't decided to accept, or not.\n  - Admins can teleport players to him/her, if the `enable_immediate_teleport` setting is enabled.\n  - Admins can teleport to protected coordinates.\n\nPlayers can also teleport to coordinates, however, if the area is protected, the teleport will be denied.\n\n## How to use\n\nEach command does a function. \"**Example usage**\" is an example of how to use the command.<br>\nNote there must be 2 players in order to make the commands to work: a player must send a request to another player.\n\nThere are two ways of sending a request:\n\n1. A request which teleports you to the specified player (command `/tpr <player>`).<br>\n2. A request which teleports the specified player to you (command `/tphr <player>`).\n\nTo accept a request some sent you, you must use `/tpy`.<br>\nThese are the following commands available in-game:\n\n``` /tpr [playername] ```\n\n- **Name:** Teleport Request\n- **Description:** Requests permission to teleport to another player, where [playername] is their exact name.\n- **Required privileges:** `interact, tp`\n- **Example usage:** `/tpr RobbieF` requests permission from RobbieF to teleport to them.\n- **Notes:** Usernames are case-sensitive. If you have the `tp_admin` privilege, you will immediately teleport to the specificed player (does not apply if `enable_immediate_teleport` setting is disabled, enabled by default).\n\n``` /tphr [playername] ```\n\n- **Name:** Teleport Here Request\n- **Description:** Request permission to teleport another player to you.\n- **Required privileges:** `interact, tp`\n- **Example usage:** `/tphr RobbieF` requests RobbieF to teleport to you.\n- **Notes:** Usernames are case-sensitive. If you have the `tp_admin` privilege, RobbieF will teleport to you immediately (does not apply if `enable_immediate_teleport` setting is disabled, enabled by default).\n\n``` /tpc [x,y,z] ```\n\n- **Name:** Teleport to Coordinates\n- **Description:** Teleport to coordinates.\n- **Required privileges:** `interact, tp_tpc, tp`\n- **Notes:** Honors area protection. If the area is protected, it must be owned by you in order to teleport to it, or you must have the `areas` privilege in order to teleport to those coordinates.\n\n``` /tpj [axis] [distance] ```\n\n- **Name:** Teleport Jump\n- **Description:** Teleport a specified distance along a single specified axis.\n- **Required privilege:** `interact\", tp, tp_tpc`\n- **Available options for *axis*:** x, y, z\n- **Example usage:** `/tpj y 10` teleport 10 nodes into the air.\n\n``` /tpe ```\n\n- **Name:** Teleport Evade\n- **Description:** In a sticky situation? Evade your enemy by teleporting to several nearby coordinates in random pattern. There's no knowing where you'll end up.\n- **Required privileges:** `interact, tp_tpc, tp`\n- **Example usage:** `/tpe` teleports you to a random number of random coordinates in an evasive pattern.\n\n``` /tpy ```\n\n- **Description:** Accept a user's request to teleport to you or teleport you to them.\n- **Required privileges:** `interact, tp`\n\n``` /tpn ```\n\n- **Description:** Deny a user's request to teleport to you or teleport you to them.\n- **Required privileges:** `interact, tp`\n\n## Configuring the mod\n\nOpen your `minetest.conf` located in your Minetest directory.<br>\nSet the values of the settings you'd like to.\n\nAvailable options are:\n\n```conf\ntp.timeout_delay = 60\ntp.enable_immediate_teleport = true\ntp_enable_tpp_command = false\n```\n\nThose values are the default values of the mod.<br>\nYou can also go to your Minetest, Settings tab, All settings, Mods, and you'll find `tpr` there.<br>\nOr another way to do it, is changing the values in `settingtypes.txt`.\n\n## TODO\n\n- Add limitations to /tpc which only allow a user to teleport X number of blocks. Prevents users from teleporting to the edge of the world.\n- Assess value in changing all tpr-based chat commands to one global command such as /tp to reduce the chance of confusion between tps_admin and the original mod (and also make it so people don't have to remember so many commands).\n- Rewrite to place all chat commands into one single command much like how /teleport works.\n- Make evade respect land: no teleporting inside land, but instead make sure player is standing on surface or in water.\n\nIf you think something else should be added to this list, [submit an issue](https://github.com/minetest-mods/teleport-request/issues/new).\n",
