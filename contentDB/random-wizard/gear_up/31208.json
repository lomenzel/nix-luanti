  "long_description": "# gear_up\n\nhttps://codeberg.org/random-wizard/gear_up/raw/branch/main/screenshot.png\n\nMod for luanti to allow character to equip items; jewelry, armor, outfits, etc... Also has a basic crate system to allow loot boxes to appear in different block types and depths; ice crates, sand crates, deep stone crates, etc...\n\nCode is a fork of mod equippable accessories.\nhttps://content.minetest.net/packages/davidthecreator/equippable_accessories/\n\nEven though this mod is self contained, I would not recommend running this mod in conjuction with equippable_accessories or 3d_armor. It will produce a lot of duplicate items that do similar things but are slightly different. It will also produce duplicate inventory tabs that do similar things but are slightly different.\n",
