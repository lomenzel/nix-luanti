  "long_description": "# What this does\n\nIt increases the size of the hotbar, that row of item displayed at the bottom of your HUD for items you can switch to.\n\nThis mod attempts to be a little more compatible with [Mineclonia](https://content.minetest.net/packages/ryvnf/mineclonia/) and tries to reuse the same textures. Should be compatible with mineclone2 but is untested.\n\n# Usage/Features\n\nInstead of specifying an arbitrary number of slots, you will need to specify the number of rows of inventory to display. In other words, a multiple of the inventory width.\n\nTypically, the hotbar is equal to the the first row of your inventory.\n\nSee `k_wider_hotbar.number_of_rows` in game settings. Defaults to 4\n\nThe reason for using multiples of the inventory width is mostly aesthetics - to be able to reuse the same UI textures as the game this mod is running on. It's easier (just a little bit) to stitch multiples of the same row along the edge than try to overlap cells nicely.\n\n# Limitations\n\nThere is an engine limitation where maximum number of hotbar slots is 32. This may eventually be addressed by https://github.com/minetest/minetest/pull/14321\n\n`default` game will have 32 inventory slots with hotbar = 8 slots. So max number of rows you can display here is 4\n\n`mineclonia` and other minecraft clones will have 36 inventory slots with hotbar = 9 slots. But since trying to display everything would exceed the limit of 32, we only display 3 rows or 27 items, meaning you'll still one last inaccessible row.\n\nCan get weird on lower resolutions as minetest will try to stack your hotbar into 2 rows, and may not work well on mobile.\n\n# License\n\nEverything [GPL 3.0 or Later](https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html).\n\n",
