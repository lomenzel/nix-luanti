  "long_description": "# Purpose\n\nHave you ever played [Mineclonia](https://content.luanti.org/packages/ryvnf/mineclonia/) and wished you could use the [`worldedit`](https://content.luanti.org/packages/sfan5/worldedit/) tools but were too scared of messing up chat commands and the `worldedit_gui` does not work because it requires specific inventory GUIs to be installed?\n\nThis mod fills that gap by adding a makeshift/semi-convenient GUI frontend to access all registered `worldedit` chat commands via a tool instead of inventory only buttons.\n\nIt technically should be compatible with any game, unless incompatible with the [flow](https://content.luanti.org/packages/luk3yx/flow/) package which is used to build the UI.\n\nFeel free to open issues for bugs and suggestions.\n\n# Usage/Features\n\n * Either use in creative mode or `/giveme k_worldedit_gui:command_tablet` to acquire the Tablet of Worldly Commands .\n * Sort of has a far wand built in on `use` (click).\n    * Behaves a bit like additive wand.\n    * Otherwise, markers still works with other worldedit wands as long as they use the same 2 marker system.\n * Available commands depend on player privileges. You will at least require `server` or `worldedit` privilege for most of them.\n * `place` (right-click) to show UI to build commands.\n    * Select command from list.\n    * Then proceed to param builder.\n * Conveniently set/clear `pos1` and `pos2` coordinates from the UI for finetuning.\n * All available commands are shown and parameter entry is free form. It's what power users call powerful.\n    * Especially useful is the `//lua` command where you can now just paste lua code in a text area and run it.\n    * Help text and description shown in same window because it's hard remember all that.\n * Commands parameters are remembered for that session and are kept separate per command. So you can relaunch the same command with the same parameters multiple times.\n * `<node[1-4]>` placeholder substitution in the command.\n\n# Limitations and Things To Do\n\n * [`worldeditadditions`](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Starbeamrainbowlabs/worldeditadditions/) and other `worldedit` related mods that register new commands should work, however..\n    * Some of the aliases may get muddled and buttons with duplicate functionality may show up.\n    * Help text and parameter hints between mods may be inconsistent.\n    * todo - hide some of the less useful commands.\n * todo - Node name placeholder search. Currently just a dropdown - lots of scrolling involved.\n * todo - increment/decrement buttons for marker coordinates possibly.\n * More styling, scrollable containers, etc.\n * De-spaghettify code.\n\n# License\n\nEverything [GPL 3.0 or Later](https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html).\n",
