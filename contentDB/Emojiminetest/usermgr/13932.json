Use `/usermgr` command to open it.\n\nThe interface is mostly self-documentated, so no worry.\n\nNote that only players with `basic_privs` can manage all accounts, otherwise they could only manage their own.\n\n<span style=\"coor:red\">**`WARNING!`**</span> On large servers (>~100 players), this may cause huge lag. Please test it on local world copies first. Please report the test results to me, as I've never tested such case.\n\n","maintainers":["Emojiminetest"],"media_license":"MIT","name":"usermgr","provides":["usermgr"],"release":13932,"repo":"https://github.com/C-C-Minetest-Server/usermgr","score":155.7,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/a557b8c943.png"],"short_description":"GUI to manage players","state":"APPROVED","tags":["world_tools"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/a557b8c943.png","title":"User Manager","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/Emojiminetest/usermgr/releases/13932/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"Emojiminetest/usermgr":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"flow","packages":["Kimapr/nonsensical_skyblock","luk3yx/flow"]}],"luk3yx/flow":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"formspec_ast","packages":["luk3yx/prang","RedundantC/wis_part1","luk3yx/formspec_ast","Kimapr/nonsensical_skyblock","Thunder1035/pacman"]}]},"hash":"0cahsc6gh29g8fabbc1fc60bwiq8ngpj15hsnjad3fzi2dsm1yna"}
