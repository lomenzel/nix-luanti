  "long_description": "# Fixing floating sands\n\nThis mod enhances map generation; it replaces any falling blocks above air into their solid form. Currently, Minetest Game and Ethereal mod is supported. Other mods could register their list of falling nodes by adding entries into the `fix_floating.list_nodes` table.\n\nNow, no sand nor gravel would fall upon contact; but this raises another question; what keeps the sandstones in place? The 9.81 meters per second gravity due to Earth is being ignored...\n\n## Known Bugs\n\n* If a WorldEdit operation places supported falling blocks out of the currently emerged areas without support, they would be transformed into solid blocks. This is due to those modifications being done pre-emerge; the phenomenon of such blocks being affected by map generation (e.g. ore generation) is a known upstream bug.",
