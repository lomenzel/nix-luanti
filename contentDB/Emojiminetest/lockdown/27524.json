If any player without `server` or `privs` privileges attempts to join during maintenance, they will be rejected for an optional reason.\n\nWhether the server is in maintenance is controlled by the existence of `<world>/lockdown.txt`; if present, its content is the reason for maintenance. It can also be controlled by a chatcommand (`/lockdown on/off [<reason>]`).\n","maintainers":["Emojiminetest"],"media_license":"LGPL-2.1-or-later","name":"lockdown","provides":["lockdown"],"release":27524,"repo":"https://github.com/C-C-Minetest-Server/lockdown","score":5.3,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/c57a661942.png"],"short_description":"Keep non-admin players away during maintainence","state":"APPROVED","tags":["multiplayer","server_tools"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/c57a661942.png","title":"Server Lockdown","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/Emojiminetest/lockdown/releases/27524/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"Emojiminetest/lockdown":[]},"hash":"0xb0li15a57qi91apwp538xm97crslvpybm5fcksrm2fpv5minfl"}
