This mod workarounds this by restarting the server when it is in extreme lag.\n\nServer administrators should fine-tune the settings to prevent false-positives. To prevent bad values from causing a restart loop, any players sending \"hang on\" can pause the restart counter.\n\nThis mod assumes you have external restart mechanics, e.g. Docker container with `restart: always`, or systemd service with `Restart=always`.","maintainers":["Emojiminetest"],"media_license":"LGPL-3.0-or-later","name":"lag_recover","provides":["lag_recover"],"release":27519,"repo":"https://github.com/C-C-Minetest-Server/lag_recover","score":1.8,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/fd8475d9f3.jpg"],"short_description":"Restart the server when it lags too much","state":"APPROVED","tags":["complex_installation","server_tools"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/fd8475d9f3.png","title":"Recover from irrecoverable lag","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/Emojiminetest/lag_recover/releases/27519/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"Emojiminetest/lag_recover":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"settings_loader","packages":["Emojiminetest/settings_loader"]}],"Emojiminetest/settings_loader":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"logging","packages":["Casimir/voxelgarden","Emojiminetest/logging"]}]},"hash":"01wcqidid6i1jw898i8z95r524jsq92v7hhqf3bslgwzr7h8clhg"}
