  "long_description": "# Superimposed Window Frames - si_frames\n\nThis mod is a fork of [Smacker's `si_frames` mod](https://github.com/h-v-smacker/si_frames) and is backward-compactible.\n\nThis mod provides a small assortment of window frames that can be added to any xpane-like\nglass surface. The object itself is shifted relatively to the placing position, so the result\nis both objects sharing the same space, as if the glass is inside the frame. While this isn't\nparticularly useful with obsidian glass, regular and stained glass types produce the desired\neffect.\n\nCurrently, woods from [Minetest Game](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Minetest/minetest_game/),\n[Ethereal](https://content.minetest.net/packages/TenPlus1/ethereal/), [Maple](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Duvalon/maple/)\nand [MineClone2](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/mineclone2/) are supported.\n\n## How to use\n\nStand in front of the glass pane and place the frame on it. To remove, use the hitbox\nthat will appear in front of the glass. It is slightly smaller than a regular node box to\nmake it easier to tell apart.\n\nRegular square frame (▢):\n\n```\nstick,   stick,            stick\nstick,   %wood_planks%,    stick\nstick,   stick,            stick\n```\n\nQuartered square frame (▢ + ✛):\n\n```\n\"\",      stick,            \"\"\nstick,   %wood_planks%,    stick\n\"\",      stick,            \"\"\n```\n\nDiagonally quartered frame (▢ + ✕):\n\n```\nstick,   \"\",               stick\n\"\",      %wood_planks%,    \"\"\nstick,   \"\",               stick\n```\n\nRhombus frame (▢ + ◇):\n\n```\n\"\",      stick,            stick\n\"\",      %wood_planks%,    \"\"\nstick,   stick,            \"\"\n```\n",
