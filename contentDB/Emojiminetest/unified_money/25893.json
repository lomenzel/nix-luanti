  "long_description": "# Unified API for in-game currency\n\nThis mod provides a unified API for managing in-game currency. With this mod, mod creators can concentrate on their mod instead of messing up with different currency mods.\n\n## Shipped submods\n\n* `um_core`: The core. Defines the unified API, and handle registration of backend.\n* `um_translate_common`: Common translatable strings.\n* `um_backend_plain`: A Unified Money backend that works out-of-the-box. It is standalone, which means it doesn't interact with data of other currency mods.\n* `um_backend_dummy`: Testing backend of Unified Money, not storing its data onto disk. USE IT IN TEST ENVIRONMENTS ONLY!\n* `um_migrate_plain`: Reads data of `um_backend_plain` and write it into the currently active backend. Conflicts with `um_backend_plain`.\n* `um_dump_data`: Dump all data of the current backend into a `um_backend_plain`-compactibible file\n* `um_frontend_cmd`: A chatcommand-based interface for interacting with Unified Money. Depends on `lib_chatcmdbuilder`.\n* `um_plugin_playername`: Create or delete accounts on player account creation/deletion. In another word, this mod enforces a relationship between player accounts and Unified Money accounts. External mods, backends and frontends assuming this relationship should depend on this mod.\n\nNote that you can only enable one backend at a time, i.e. `um_backend_plain` and `um_backend_dummy` cannot be enabled at the same time.\n\n## Structure\n\nThe `um_core` mod handles the conversation between the easy-to-use frontend APIs and the basic backend APIs, and ensure one (and only one) backend is installed. Mods willing to use Unified Money should depend on this mod. The syntax of the frontend API is documented in `um_core/README.md`.\n\nBackends should depend on `um_core` and use `unified_money.register_backend` to register the backend. Only one mod can register a backend, or in other words, only one backend mod can be loaded. The syntax of the backend API is documented in `um_backend_plain/init.lua`.\n\nMod developers should avoid the direct use of backend APIs, as frontend APIs implements safety checks and logging functions.\n\n## TODOs\n\n* [ ] Flow-based Formspec GUI for management\n* [ ] More backend implements\n  * Other backends will be published as their own mod in CDB, not included in this modpack.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (C) 2023-2024  1F616EMO\n\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
