  "long_description": "# MC2.0 for MineClone2, the April Fool's version\n\nThis modpack aims to add \"features\" (read: chaos) added in [Minec**** 2.0](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_2.0).\n\nFeatures done:\n\n* The [Etho Slab](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Etho_Slab): slab variant of [TNT](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/TNT), but spawns anvil above entities around the explosion.\n* Modified [Block of Coal](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Block_of_Coal): Using the modified texture of [Block of Redstone](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Block_of_Redstone), [Coal](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Coal) crafted from this block cannot be stacked with other coals.\n* Explosive [Furnaces](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Furnace): If furnaces are run for a very long time, it may overheat and eventually explode.\n\nFeatures that are actually part of existing gameplay:\n\n* Tinted [Glass](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Glass): Glass with colors. They are already added in [Minec**** 1.7.2](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_1.7.2) under the name Stained Glass. Don't be confused with the [Tinted Glass](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tinted_glass) added in [Minec**** 1.17](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_1.17).\n\nFeatures not yet implemented:\n\n* [Burunt-out Torches](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Torch_(Burnt-out)): Torches will burn out after a random period of time. Use [Flint and Steel](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Flint_and_steel) to relit them. Use [Lanterns](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Lantern) if you don't want to be annoyed.\n* Pig Horses and Cow Horses: Retextured pigs and cows obtainable via spawn eggs.\n* Pink Wither: A \"hostile\" (read: friendly) boss that restores health to mobs and applies bone meal to surrounding blocks.\n* [Diamond Chickens](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Diamond_Chicken): Rarely spawns instead of a normal chicken, lays [diamonds](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Diamond) or [lapis lazuli](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Lapis_lazuli), or explodes instead of laying eggs.\n* [Floppers](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Dropper): Renamed droppers that always drop [raw fish](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Raw_Cod).\n* Fat animals: Pigs, Mooshrooms, Cows, Sheep, and Chickens will become so fat after 10 feds that they explode.\n* Flying [Sheep](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Sheep): Using a [golden apple](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_apple) makes them fly.\n* \"Battle signs\" of [Zombie Pigmen](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Zombie_Pigmen): Zombified Piglin now carry \"battle signs\".\n* \"Super Hostile Mode\": Very awful situations where players are struck by lightning bolts and attacked by strong mobs.\n* Speech bubbles: blocks and mobs may give reactions through speech bubbles.\n\nFeatures waiting for MineClone 2 or Minetest Engine features:\n\n* [Redstone Bug](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Redstone_Bug): Retextured [silverfish](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Silverfish), spawns when Redstone strength increases. Since the Redstone system in MineClone 2 is not yet well-implemented, it is impossible for this feature to function properly.\n* Super HD Graphics: Makes all textures monochrome. It is currently impossible to change block textures on the fly, and creating a copy of all textures is impractical and would be incompatible with non-MineClone mods.\n",
