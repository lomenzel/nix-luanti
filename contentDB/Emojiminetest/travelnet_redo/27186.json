A lightweight and well-maintained base for modding","thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/8ffd1409ff.png","title":"Minetest Game","type":"game"},"supports":true}],"issue_tracker":"https://github.com/C-C-Minetest-Server/travelnet_redo/issues","license":"GPL-3.0-or-later","long_description":"# Travelnet Redo\n\nThis is a rewrite of the [original Travelnet mod](https://content.minetest.net/packages/mt-mods/travelnet/), using PostgreSQL as the storage backend.\n\nThis rewrite is based on [commit `fad216d` of mt-mods' fork](https://github.com/mt-mods/travelnet/commit/fad216db52b8fc8fafa11868d80c9e35c4b4a7ac), a fork of the [unmaintained upstream](https://github.com/Sokomine/travelnet) By Sokomine.\n\n## Why this fork?\n\n* **No more bloated API**: You can create travelnets not only in box-like shape\n* **Cleaner codes**: Getting rid of 12 years of ancient debris hidden deep inside codes\n* **Lesser memory usage**: Not having to load all networks the player owns to load one network\n* **More flexibility**: Allow admins to change the owner and the name (to-do) of a network easily\n* **No hacky travelnet removal code**: Travelnets can be dug normally instead of asking for detachment in the UI\n* **No more [cramped UIs](https://github.com/mt-mods/travelnet/issues/53)**: Using flow as the GUI library, the elements align themselves neatly\n\n## Travelnets catalogue\n\n* Default travelnets: Original box-like travelnets that come with this mod, in 15 colors\n* [Fancy travelnets](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Emojiminetest/travelnet_redo_fancy/): Travelnets with fancy textures, magic themed\n* [Travelnet beacons](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Emojiminetest/travelnet_redo_beacons/): Single-node travelnet (not box-shaped)\n\n## Changes\n\n* **This mod is not a drop-in replacement of the original Travelnet mod.** Contributions are welcomed, but I don't plan to write migration scripts.\n* Elevators are not included. This is mainly my personal choice - use [more realistic elevators](https://content.minetest.net/packages/shacknetisp/elevator/), they are not bad.\n* Punching the travelnet no longer updates it. Instead, they are always up-to-date, and a cache system ensures the robustness of displays.\n* The number of travelnets in a network is no longer limited to 24. Though packed, the system properly handles the display of >24 travelnets.\n* A sorting key field is added. This is a 2-bit signed integer controlling how travelnets should be sorted when listed, the smaller the upper. Travelnets first get sorted by their sorting key, then case-insensitive alphabetically.\n* Apart from \"(P)\" meaning protected, \"(I)\" means enter only - you can't exit from that travelnet unless you own that travelnet.\n* If travelnet names start with integers, they are sorted numerically.\n\n## Installation\n\nThis mod requires `pgmoon` and `luasocket`. Use the following command to install them:\n\n```bash\nluarocks install pgmoon\nluarocks install luasocket\n```\n\nAfter installing, configure the following in your `minetest.conf` (see [`pgmoon.new`](https://github.com/leafo/pgmoon#newoptions) for full options list):\n\n```text\n# We need insecure environment access\nsecure.trusted_mods = travelnet_redo\n\n# Note that this differs from backend definitions in world.mt\ntravelnet_redo.pg_connection = database=minetest host=127.0.0.1 port=5432 user=minetest password=password\n```\n\nOf course, configure your PostgreSQL server accordingly. You can safely share the same database with all Minetest storage.","maintainers":["Emojiminetest"],"media_license":"CC-BY-SA-3.0","name":"travelnet_redo","provides":["travelnet_redo"],"release":27186,"repo":"https://github.com/C-C-Minetest-Server/travelnet_redo","score":23,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/d0e9137ee4.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/d66d0a7a2b.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/97ed78fce4.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/8995f9f9f8.png"],"short_description":"Travelnet with improved performance and code tidiness","state":"APPROVED","tags":["complex_installation","transport"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/d0e9137ee4.png","title":"Travelnet Redo","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/Emojiminetest/travelnet_redo/releases/27186/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"Emojiminetest/logging":[],"Emojiminetest/settings_loader":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"logging","packages":["Casimir/voxelgarden","Emojiminetest/logging"]}],"Emojiminetest/travelnet_redo":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"settings_loader","packages":["Emojiminetest/settings_loader"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"logging","packages":["Casimir/voxelgarden","Emojiminetest/logging"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"modlib","packages":["LMD/modlib","zanderdev/skyblock_zero","sdd/spiraling_down","LMD/cellestial_game","Kimapr/nonsensical_skyblock"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"flow","packages":["Kimapr/nonsensical_skyblock","luk3yx/flow"]}],"LMD/modlib":[],"luk3yx/flow":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"formspec_ast","packages":["luk3yx/prang","RedundantC/wis_part1","luk3yx/formspec_ast","Kimapr/nonsensical_skyblock","Thunder1035/pacman"]}]},"hash":"0arn2yvv9jqlz36h0kln6ipcmck48wn4b521rgm0qrsw454cfk8h"}
