  "long_description": "This adds nodes for dogs and dog fur. They can be crafted with wool.\nMany dogs bark if another dog is next to them or an object such as a player or dropped item is near them. They also make a sound when punched. And they glow.\n\nThe mod is based on Dogzilla131's DogBlocks mod. \nFor more details, please read the forum topic.\n",
