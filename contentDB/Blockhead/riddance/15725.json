  "long_description": "# Riddance: Rid yourself of stuff you don't want\n\nDon't like fire? Want to hide TNT from the creative menu? Maybe get rid of that\nannoying biome from your favourite game or a useless chat command? You can do\nall of these things with Riddance.\n\nRiddance can rid you of:\n\n* Items - which means nodes, craftitems, and tools\n* Biomes\n* Chat commands\n\nRiddance can also hide items from the creative inventory.\n\n## Important Links\n\n* [ContentDB](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Blockhead/riddance/)\n* [Forums](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=28918)\n* [Source on GitHub](https://github.com/Montandalar/riddance)\n\n## Who and what is riddance for?\n\nRiddance is for people that want to remove certain small things from their\nworld without needing to code and without needing to modify the mods that add\nthose undesired things.\n\nRiddance is not a proper solution for more complicated tasks like preventing\npeople from using stuff without removing it entirely. Assume that players will\nget their hands on any item hidden by riddance in some other way than via the\ncreative inventory, such as `/give` or their friends. Instead of relying on\nsecurity by obscurity, take the proper measures such as privilege checks.\n\nRiddance is not a complete solution for existing worlds. You will need other\nmods to remove unknown nodes and unknown items that it might cause. Deleting\nbiomes will probably result in discontinuities between old and new map\ngeneration.\n\nRiddance has no mod load order issues, Riddance runs after all the mods are\nloaded. Riddance can run for any game or mod in Minetest, not just specific ones\nlike Minetest Game, Mineclone or Ethereal.\n\n## Configuring riddance\n\nRiddance is configured with lists of things to rid and hide. You simply write a\nlist of the things, each separated by a comma, to rid/hide all of them in the\nlist. Spaces can optionally be used. For example to rid yourself of fire, flint\nand steel, and TNT  in Minetest Game, you would configure `Ridding items` in the\nmenu (`riddance.rid_items` technical name) like so:\n\n```fire:basic_flame,fire:flint_and_steel,tnt:tnt```\n\nYou can show itemstrings (technical names) for all inventory items by enabling\nSettings -> Graphics and Audio -> User Interfaces -> GUIs -> Append item name,\nwhich if done via minetest.conf would be the line\n\n```tooltip_append_itemname = true```\n\n## API\n\nSee the functions exported at the bottom of `init.lua`. There is no particular\nbenefit to using these if you already know what you are doing, barring some\nfuture update like a riddance GUI.\n\n## Licence\n\nRiddance is licensed under the BSD 3-Clause License, see `LICENSE.txt` for details.\n",
