Then you can brew with gunpowder to get a splash soothing potion, and then with dragon breath to get a lingering soothing potion.\n\n![](/uploads/717441c2a0.png)\n\nYou can also craft a bucket of chocolate milk, which removes effects and also gives you a tiny bit of food.\n\n# Credits and license\nThe code is licensed [GPL 3.0](https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-only.html).\n\nThe graphics are licensed under [MIT License](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html) and are derived from [Mineclonia](https://content.luanti.org/packages/ryvnf/mineclonia/)\n",
