The number is the radius of the explosion.\n\n\nExample:\n\n``` lua\ngroups = {explosive = 3}\n```\n\n# Trap chest\n\nTo make a trap chest place the explodingchest:trap craftitem into any volatile chest. If the chest contains any explosive materials it will blow up on right click.\n\nexplodingchest:trap Has no crafting receipt. You have to give it one.\n\n# Settings\n\nTo limit the size of the explosion.\n\n``` lua\nexplodingchest.explosion_max = 11\n```\n\nThe way the explosion is calculated.\n\nMultiply means explosive material is multiplied.\n\nReduce means the initial explosion size is set to the biggest explosive material then the rest is dividend by reduce.\n\n``` lua\nexplodingchest.radius_comput = \"reduce\"\n```\n\nThe amount to divide by. (this is only in use if radius_comput is set to reduce)\n\n``` lua\nexplodingchest.reduce = 288\n```\n\nThese settings can be changed in advanced settings.\n\n# Blast Type\n\nInstant blast type means the volatile container will blow up in 0 seconds.\n\nEntity blast type means the volatile container will turn into a entity (You need tnt_revamped mod turn on for this)\n\nTimer blast type means the volatile container will have a delay before blowing up.\n\n``` lua\nexplodingchest.blast_type = \"instant\"\n```\n\nThis setting is for when the volatile container is opened and theres a trap craftitem inside.\n\nInstant blast type means the volatile container will blow up in 0 seconds.\n\nEntity blast type means the volatile container will turn into a entity (You need tnt_revamped mod turn on for this)\n\nTimer blast type means the volatile container will have a delay before blowing up.\n\n``` lua\nexplodingchest.trap_blast_type = \"instant\"\n```\n\nBlast delay timer (only works for entity and timer)\n\nIf timer is set to zero then the timer is auto set to the blast radius size.\n\n``` lua\nexplodingchest.timer = 0\n```\n","maintainers":["Coder12"],"media_license":"MIT","name":"explodingchest","provides":["explodingchest"],"release":9682,"repo":"https://gitlab.com/Coder12a/explodingchest","score":1.6,"screenshots":[],"short_description":"Api-mod to allow containers like chest to explode if it contains explosive materials.","state":"APPROVED","tags":["library"],"thumbnail":null,"title":"Exploding Chest","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/Coder12/explodingchest/releases/9682/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"Coder12/explodingchest":[]},"hash":"0w8vb8kqcr98sdmianr39ks8g79hxc70nhg23bd005w092xc4y61"}
