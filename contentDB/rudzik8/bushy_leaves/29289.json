Now with better performance (thanks to meshes) and proper [Plantlife](https://content.luanti.org/packages/mt-mods/plantlife_modpack/) support.\n\nTested with:\n\n* [Minetest Game](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Minetest/minetest_game/)\n* [VoxeLibre](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Wuzzy/mineclone2/)\n* [Repixture](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Wuzzy/repixture/)\n* [NodeCore](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Warr1024/nodecore/)\n* [Mineclonia](https://content.luanti.org/packages/ryvnf/mineclonia/)\n\n\n## `full` vs `cheap`\n\nIt can be hard to choose what mesh type you want for bushy leaves. By default\nit is `full`, but you can configure bushy leaves to render with the `cheap`\nmesh instead.\n\n`full` mesh is (almost) identical to the the nodebox that was used in the\noriginal mod.\n\n![Screenshot: bushy leaves with `full` mesh type](/uploads/09f97b2b65.png)\n\n`cheap` mesh has been simplified to get better performance. But it wasn't a\nlossless optimization; you can see the differences from the `full` mesh here.\n\n![Screenshot: bushy leaves with `cheap` mesh type](/uploads/60e6648690.png)\n\nThe choice is completely up to you. But if you're a server owner and want to\nuse this mod on your server (god forbid), at the very least do all your players\nwith lower end devices a favor and go with `cheap`.\n\nBoth meshes were created by singularis-mzf, see `models/license.txt`.\n","maintainers":["rudzik8"],"media_license":"AGPL-3.0-or-later","name":"bushy_leaves","provides":["bushy_leaves"],"release":29289,"repo":"https://codeberg.org/rudzik8/bushy_leaves","score":326.7,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/0bfd775450.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/09f97b2b65.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/60e6648690.png"],"short_description":"Makes leaves render bushy instead of boxy.
