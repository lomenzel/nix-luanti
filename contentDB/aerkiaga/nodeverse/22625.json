Inspired by games like No Man's Sky, it is instead based on voxel mechanics. Some of the final playable mechanics are already implemented.\n\n## How to play\nThese are the instructions for playing this version of **Nodeverse**.\n\nYou will begin flying on a small spaceship. Use 'jump' (space by default), 'sneak' (shift by default) and the movement keys to control it. You can land the ship by pressing 'sneak', and lift up again by pressing 'jump' or unboard by pressing any movement key. Once landed, the ship can be modified, by digging or placing nodes and hull plates, or punching scaffold nodes to shape them.\n\nIf you fly high enough, you'll break out of the atmosphere and into outer space. You can return to the planet by flying lower using 'sneak'. There's also a GUI that you can open with the inventory button; this shows planets around you and, when in space, can be used to visit them.\n\nIn each planet, you can collect flora to advance your discovery gallery, which you can also access via the inventory button, and shows all the planets you've visited and the species you've collected.\n\nMost planets contain precious loot in the form of colorful piñatas that drop new spaceship parts upon breaking. There is one piñata hidden somewhere on the surface of each planet. Find it and use those parts to customize your ship to your liking, or even build a new one.\n\n## How to help\nThis game is aimed to be a complex space exploration adventure... someday. For now, there are many ways to lend a hand and build it together:\n\n* **Try it** and [report bugs](https://github.com/aerkiaga/nodeverse/issues)!\n* Have an idea? Please tell the developer and discuss it!\n* Get your hands [dirty](https://github.com/aerkiaga/nodeverse).
