  "long_description": "The WhyNot? game is a mod collection style subgame based on [minetest game](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Minetest/minetest_game/). It can be enjoyed as both a survival challenge with many goals and different places to explore, or as a creative framework for building amazing things!\n\n## Survival\n\nUpon entering the game, the player will see what appears to be a plain Mintetest Game. After a brief moment of exploration, harvesting grass and cutting trees, you may come across some vegetables. Those can be harvested and re-planted to begin farming and be saved from starvation. Paying close attention to the surroundings, sounds and weather effects bring additional ambience.\n\nBefore the night falls, you will want to find, create or dig a simple shelter, as well as a light source... or get ready to fight some monsters. Be especially wary of ghosts as they are very strong for beginners. The 'E' key can be held in order to run away faster from your foes. Wielding a torch instead of a tool or weapon will illuminate the immediate surroundings. Craft some basic tools like a wood or stone pick axe to increase your odds of survival. Crafting is similar to Minetest Game and Minecraft, albeit without the need for a crafting table. The shapes can be found in the craft guide.\n\nWhen the sun rises again it is time resume exploration and find a suitable place for a more permanent settlement. Then one should begin digging deeper to get more and better minerals.\n\n### Tracking Progress\n\nThe WhyNot? game uses three main mechanisms to track progress: a progressive craft guide, awards/achievements, and tool ranks.\n\nAs new materials are discovered, new recipes become visible in the craft guide. Discovering new materials and items also unlocks help documentation to provide assistance when needed. As such, it is one of the goals of the WhyNot? game to find as many materials as possible, and craft all the items available in order to discover the whole crafting tree.\n\nThe second mechanism to track progress is the awards. The awards will not only guide you towards your next steps, it will give challenging goals to achieve in completing the game.\n\nFinally, tools and weapons can be repaired which, by itself, doesn't help save materials. However it allows them to level up! This makes them more resistant to wear, and more powerful too. To level up a tool, it must be used many more times than the usual wear and tear cycle. This is where repairing comes in. A repaired tool or weapon will be returned to new, but it's experience (usage counter) remains. Careful not to let them break though, as then the progress is lost.\n\n### Tools\n\nMany tools have been added to the WhyNot? game that make life easier, and the game play more enjoyable. For example, those from mods like ccompass, engrave, flyingcarpet, handholds, helicopter, maidroid, orbs_of_time, rainbowswords, subspacewalker, and boost_cart as mesecons-enabled replacement for of MTG-carts. For communication or mini-games a laptop can also be crafted and used.\n\n### Monsters\n\nThe monsters from mobs_monster and ghosts provide extra challenges, especially deep underground with the dungeon masters.\n\n### Exploration\n\nThe exploration experience in WhyNot is seemingly very similar to Minetest Game at first. One of the first thing to notice is a deeper dirt and sand layer to dig before getting to rock. Tall mountains also have a novel look with a snowy top. With a bit of patience and hard work, a greater variety of dungeons may be found. While digging underground, ores are not available immediately. Rock, bronze, and steel tools will each need to be used longer and repaired to make it to the deeper layers. Back to top-side again, an airplane can be built to reach floating islands.\n\n## Creative Crafting and Building\n\nThe WhyNot? game contains many craftable decorative items, furniture, and building materials from mods like like abriglass, homedecor, mydoors, myroofs, princess, ts_furniture, curtain, flower_pot, realchess, campfire, dice2, heads, mtg_plus, plasticbox, slats, and more!\n\nThere are many types of armours to build, and clothes to weave with cotton and colored with dyes.\n\nSome but not all of mesecons is also available to build machines.\n\n## Release Notes\n\n**Version 2023-03-16 Release notes:**\n\nWe've removed the endless apples alias. Super unlikely this effects anyone, but there's a slim chance of some unknown nodes from 2018.\n\n**Version 2022-11-10 Release notes:**\n\nWhynot's under the GPLv3 only. This means that unfortunately, the `helicotper` mod (which was under `GPLv2-only` ) had to be removed, since it isn't GPLv3 compatible. We are looking for a clean-room replacement of similar feature-set that provides an upgrade path.\n\n**Version 2022-04-01 Release notes:**\n\nI given up the \"player_api_modpack\" (https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=20682).  All mods from this modpack are replaced by orginial forks and skinsdb.\nFensta-skins users need to re-download the skins using skinsdb downloader. Just copying files does not work because the meta-files format is not compatible.\nplace_your_skins_here mod does not have replacement. Users have to move own skins into skinsdb textures folder. The meta-files incompatibility (if used) applies here to.",
