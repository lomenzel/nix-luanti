  "long_description": "# minenews\n\nLocalized and simple server news for Minetest servers. Original version by Shara\nRedCat, forked and improved by Ronoaldo.\n\nThis mod displays a formspec when the player joins. To set the news text to\ndisplay, make a file named news_*lang_code*.md in your world directory for\neach locale you plan to support, falling back to a news.md file if no localized\nversion is found.\n\nThe contents of this file will be displayed to the player, interpreted as\nMarkdown. When changing the contents of the file, there is no need to restart\nthe server for it to update in game so you can also test quickly the display.\n\nPlayers can also type /news to display the formspec at any time.\n\nPlayers with the news_bypass privilege will not see the formspec when they sign\nin, but can still use the /news command.\n\n# License\n\nCode for this mod is released under MIT (https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n\nThis mod uses textures from Bootstrap Icons, also licensed under MIT\n(https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).",
