  "long_description": "# Seekblock Intro\nLittle mini-game as a stand-alone mod. The goal is to find the one block that has a different texture. When someone digs that block, the game cleans itself up, and rewards the winner with some particle effects.\n\n# Usage\nUsage via chat command:\n\n```\n/seekblock <size> <percent_filled> <timeout in minutes>\n```\n\nFor example, the screenshots above were made using:\n\n```\n/seekblock 10 10\n/seekblock 2 100\n```\n\nGiving up? Either wait or use:\n\n```\n/seekblockclear\n```\n\nNote: Size is the 'half width... sorta'. If size = N, then the game area extents are (x,y,z) = (2N +1, N, 2N+1)\n\n# Features\n* no spamming -- each player can only have one active seekblock game going at one time (in theory...)\n* timeout -- Maximum game length is 10 minutes, after that it cleans itself up if there's no winner\n* max size -- Maximum number of blocks is limited to 512 (roughly... statistically)\n* max extents -- maximum game size is limited to 65 x 32 x 65 area\n* no blocks on top of players -- no one gets buried\n* half the time it's fun every time -- guaranteed for a few minutes anyway (in theory...)\n\n# TODOs\n* [ ] Some more play testing to find bugs and ways to be annoying\n* [ ] There may be game elements that I didn't account for that will prevent the cleanup efforts or make the game unwinnable\n* [ ] Better rewards -- I haven't really figured out the particle system\n\n# Questions\n* Should the nodes be falling or floating? Which is more fun? (Floating gives a parkour aspect... maybe?)\n* Should I just pick settings that are fun? Or is the size/percent_filled fun to have around for different game types?\n* Is the hidden block too hard / too easy / just hard enough to find?\n* Any other suggestions to make this releasable?\n",
