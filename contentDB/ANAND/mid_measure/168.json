  "long_description": "# Mid-Measure [mid_measure] (v1.0)\n\nMid-Measure is a Minetest mod which can be used for quickly calculating the distance (in all three axes) between two nodes, and ascertaining their mid-point, both of which are displayed in the chat (as of now; refer to TODO section below)\n\nThe calculations are performed right after pos2 has been marked, and if auto-reset has been enabled, will reset after the configured number of seconds.\n\nPartly inspired by [Minetest-WorldEdit](https://github.com/Uberi/Minetest-WorldEdit)\n\n#### License: MIT\n\n#### Mod Dependencies: default (optional; see below)\n\n#### Custom settings\n- `mid_measure.auto_reset` - Auto-reset duration. Accepts a value of `n` seconds, where `0 <= n <= 3600`. If `n==0`, auto-reset is disabled (not recommended for server environments).\n- `mid_measure.enable_crafting` - Enables crafting (disabled by default) of marker tool if true. The craft-recipe depends on `default` mod.\n\n#### How does this work?\n- Mark the first node by either of the two methods given below:\n  - Standing on a node and typing `/mark1`.\n  - Left-clicking on a node with the Marker.\n- Mark the second node by either of the two methods given below:\n  - Standing on a node and typing `/mark2`.\n  - Left-clicking on another node with the Marker.\n- The distance will automatically be calculated after marking the second node, and the mid-point will be highlighted as well.\n- Click on pos1 / pos2 / mid-point or type `/reset_mark` to manually reset at anytime.\n\n#### Craft-recipe for marker tool\nThe craft-recipe is quite simple actually. It's very similar to the recipe for torches, but the coal lump is replaced by a mese crystal fragment here.\n```\n[Mese Crystal fragment]\n        [Stick]\n\n```\n\n#### TODO\n- [ ] Re-implement mod using HUD elements to output distance and mid-point co-ords.",
