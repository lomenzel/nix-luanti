Players can use the `/block` and `/unblock` commands to manage the messages they see in the chat.\n\nThanks to Francophonia (FRANCE) for making me think about this idea.\n\n## Features\n\n- Block messages from a specific player with the `/block <player>` command.\n- Unblock messages from a specific player with the `/unblock <player>` command.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Blocking a Player\n\nTo block messages from a player, use the `/block <player>` command in chat, where `<player>` is the name of the player whose messages you want to block. For example, to block messages from the player \"example\", type:\n\n`/block playername`\n\n\n### Unblocking a Player\n\nTo unblock messages from a player, use the `/unblock <player>` command in chat, where `<player>` is the name of the player whose messages you want to unblock.
