  "long_description": "## The Ecliptic Cycle\n**Back** and ***__Forth__***,  \n***__Southward__***, **Northward**.  \n**In** and ***__Out__*** of Shadow, in an eternal dance.  \n\n###### __aʦu kɪɾ-͠ɛklɪɾa, χuɾ ɾuʦ?__\n In Luanti, *__The Moon__* is locked 180° from the Sun. No tilt or offset to catch the sun’s rays. \n So *__The Moon__* is locked in an eternal, lunar eclipse.  \n However, if we merely shift *__The Moon__* from side to side (north to south), then we can move it out of the earth's umbra; thus producing a sort of ping-pong lunar phase system.\n\n#### Features:\n* Logical lunar phase system within the Luanti constraints.\n* 17 Unique Lunar events.\n\n\n`Ecliptic_Cycle` API can be found [here](https://github.com/Extex101/ecliptic_cycle/blob/main/api.md)",
