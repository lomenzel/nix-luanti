No tilt or offset to catch the sun’s rays. \n So *__The Moon__* is locked in an eternal, lunar eclipse.  \n However, if we merely shift *__The Moon__* from side to side (north to south), then we can move it out of the earth's umbra; thus producing a sort of ping-pong lunar phase system.\n\n#### Features:\n* Logical lunar phase system within the Luanti constraints.\n* 17 Unique Lunar events.\n\n\n`Ecliptic_Cycle` API can be found [here](https://github.com/Extex101/ecliptic_cycle/blob/main/api.md)",
