  "long_description": "This mod asks players without interact to read the server rules and optionally prompts for a keyword from in said rules to be entered, at which point interact is granted. Multiple keywords are supported and the current one selected for a given player will be inserted into the rules at a location marked by \"@KEYWORD\". \n  \nThe following chat commands are provided:  \n/rules - Shows the rules, along with a prompt to agree to them (if you don't have the \"interact\" privilege) or the ability to edit them (if you have the \"server\" privilege)  \n/editrules - Goes directly to the screen for editing the rules. Requires \"server\" privilege.  \n/set_no_interact_spawn - Sets the spawnpoint for players without the \"interact\" privilege. Requires \"server\" privilege.  \n/set_interact_spawn - Sets the spawnpoint for players with the \"interact\" privilege. Requires \"server\" privilege.  \n/getkeywords - Shows the list of keywords currently used by the keyword system. Requires \"server\" privilege.  \n/addkeyword - Adds a keyword to the list. If more than one is present, a random keyword will be selected when the rules form is opened each time. Requires \"server\" privilege.  \n/delkeyword - Removes a keyword from the list. If none are present, no keyword entry will be required. Requires \"server\" privilege.  \n/spawn - Teleports to the appropriate spawn point.",
