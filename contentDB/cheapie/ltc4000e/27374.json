'digistuff' is also highly recommended, as it provides player detectors that work with this controller.  \n  \nThe digilines channels are as follows:  \n\"a\" - Straight-through signal for direction A  \n\"b\" - Straight-through signal for direction B  \n\"c\" - Straight-through signal for direction C  \n\"d\" - Straight-through signal for direction D  \n\"at\" - Signal for left turns from direction A  \n\"bt\" - Signal for left turns from direction B  \n\"ct\" - Signal for left turns from direction C  \n\"dt\" - Signal for left turns from direction D  \n\"ap\" - Pedestrian signal for crossing the direction A approach to the intersection. Note that this is **crossing** A, not **moving in** direction A.  \n\"bp\" - Same, but direction B  \n\"cp\" - Same, but direction C  \n\"dp\" - Same, but direction D  \n\"detector_\" followed by one of the above channels - Vehicle/pedestrian detector corresponding to the appropriate signal.  \n\"preempt_\" followed by a/b/c/d - Preemption for the corresponding direction.  \n  \nIn most cases, A and C will be one street, and B and D will be the other.  \nFor preemption and detectors, the digilines message does not matter, only the channel.  \n  \nConfiguration is performed by right-clicking the controller cabinet and using the menu system. If using the larger (NEMA-style) cabinet, punch it first to open the door.","maintainers":["cheapie"],"media_license":"The Unlicense","name":"ltc4000e","provides":["ltc4000e"],"release":27374,"repo":"https://cheapiesystems.com/git/ltc4000e/","score":12.5,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/7SNgptw1pj.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/pN24IDHFgD.png"],"short_description":"Advanced traffic signal controller","state":"APPROVED","tags":["building","technology"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/7SNgptw1pj.png","title":"LTC-4000E","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/cheapie/ltc4000e/releases/27374/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"Jeija/digilines":[],"cheapie/ltc4000e":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"default","packages":["AiTechEye/xaenvironment","Hi_World/newplanet","Noodlemire/voxeldungeon","JALdMIC/survivethedays","sunnysideup/holidayhorrors","BuckarooBanzay/mesecons_lab","nam/porko","Amaz/lordofthetest","1248/castrum","Thunder1035/etb","1248/regnum","Minetest/minetest_game","debiankaios/proxima_survival","carlos_rupp/berzerkpt","1248/regnum2","miroptics/qiskitblocks_miro","KareaGhandTrail/block_assault_mapmaker","KareaGhandTrail/block_assault","Casimir/voxelgarden","bell07/whynot_game","JavaFXpert/qiskitblocks","Kimapr/nonsensical_skyblock","jgordon510/gridlocks","giga-turbo/codecube","niwla23/runorfall","Thunder1035/pacman","Big_Caballito/no_mans_land","MeseCraft/mesecraft","hilol/epic_combat","TheFanne/raining_nodes","rlars/occupymoon_game","PetiAPocok/minetest_extended","mooD_Slayer/ksurvive","EmptyStar/asuna","mt-mods/dreambuilder_game","rubenwardy/capturetheflag"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"digistuff","packages":["BuckarooBanzay/mesecons_lab","BRNSystems/blocky_portaling","mt-mods/digistuff","Kimapr/nonsensical_skyblock","mt-mods/dreambuilder_game"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"digilines","packages":["BuckarooBanzay/mesecons_lab","nam/porko","BRNSystems/blocky_portaling","Jeija/digilines","Kimapr/nonsensical_skyblock","MeseCraft/mesecraft","mt-mods/dreambuilder_game"]}],"mt-mods/digistuff":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"digilines","packages":["BuckarooBanzay/mesecons_lab","nam/porko","BRNSystems/blocky_portaling","Jeija/digilines","Kimapr/nonsensical_skyblock","MeseCraft/mesecraft","mt-mods/dreambuilder_game"]}]},"hash":"19wnzlc0nl2mwkj84k2bjxnnkrbw58dqv7hw020fsg46y3jdwvc2"}
