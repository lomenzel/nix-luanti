  "long_description": "FINALLY, after a long amount of teasing on the Luanti Discord - I've finally gone through with uploading this!\n\nChange the notes by right clicking the sides - right click the bass clef for lower, treble clef for higher. Punch to play the notes!\n\nExample of all the instruments in MTG: https://files.catbox.moe/fb7xio.mp4\n\n\nModding (remind me to add an API tag when I do) and translations are not available just yet - I'll likely do such in a future release. This is just to showcase a demo of the instruments, API possibility, and its future application for cool projects :3\n\n14 instruments - with a 15th if Nodecore Bells is enabled (aka I steal their sound file to make another instrument lol).\n\nCurrently craftable and unique instrument functional in:\n- Mineclonia + VoxeLibre (including redstone wire support)\n- Minetest Game\n- Exile\n- Age of Mending (including wirecutter support)\n- Repixture\n- Hades Revisited (unique instruments haven't been all tested)\n\nWith overall support for Mesecon wiring.\n\nNot craftable in NodeCore - but it does have full instrument support (NodeCore crafting code is too confusing for me as a programmer lol) as well as optics support (though I wasn't really able to test it... As again I'm confused by how optics work lol)\n\nThe mod should be compatible with any game - but the list of games I note have been tested. It maintains no hard dependencies - just that you likely won't get crafting or unique instrument support\n\n",
