It'll play them in the background too! Perfectly-so!\n\nUtilizes io.open(path, \"rb\") to read the sound files and get their duration - only ran on world/server start\n\nDebating making the internal functions an API at some point - they're quite powerful :3\n\nThis is actually compatible with just about any game to my knowledge (as long as it doesn't have background music shrugshrug), but it's most enjoyed in Exile I imagine pfft. So I don't think I'll mention any other game as compatible just  for that reason",
