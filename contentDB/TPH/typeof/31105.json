  "long_description": "(DISCLAIMER: this is NOT for Roblox NOR is this the page for Luau's `typeof` function or luau API, have not realized how high this is in the `typeof luau` google search query lmao. This requires downloading Luanti as a prerequisite!)\n\nAs stated, provides functionality similar to the typeof function in Luau (the Lua dialect used by Roblox) - and is used in the same way!\n\nCreates global function `typeof` which can be called with any value to figure out what specific complex type it is\n\n`typeof` can return two values, the `type` and a `subdivision` if possible with the `type` (otherwise will return nil)\n\n`type`, `subdivision` = `typeof(value)`\n\nCertain types have subdivisions such as `meta` which can have `node` and `itemstack`\n\nCurrent specified types:\n\n`vector`, `voxelarea`, `player`, `object`, `inventory`, `itemstack`, `areastore`, `voxelmanip`, `meta` (subdivisions: `node`, `itemstack`, `player`, `storage` (mod storage)), `nodetimer`, `settings`, `number` (subdivisions: `float`, `integer`)\n\nThe code loads certain values such as (its own) mod storage, getting meta from point 0,0,0, or getting areas of 0,0,0 to 1,1,1 as to grab their metatables for IDs. Certain types will not be available for classification prior to the finalized loading of mods due to engine limitations (such as node-specific or position-specific). Should be perfectly fine after load time. Last possible value to be loaded is the `meta` subdivision `player` - as it requires a player to join to get the metatable ID.\n\nThis function should NOT be considered a performance alternative to `type()`. This handles more complex types - and thusly has a slightly laggier approach - like Luau's `typeof()` does. It also uses `type()` a lot too - so it cannot be faster than it lol.\n\nThere is currently no difference between detached, node, and player inventories - and thusly there does not exist subdivisions of `inventory`.",
