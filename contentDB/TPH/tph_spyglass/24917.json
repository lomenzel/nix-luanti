Games listed under compatible games have been tested by myself and confirmed to be compatible.\n\nRecipes may NOT appear in custom inventory systems due to purposeful usage of on_mods_loaded to determine whether or not to add the recipe.\n\nUses  a bronze ingot for crafting otherwise will override with brass if **basic_materials** is enabled\nhttps://content.minetest.net/packages/AwesomeDragon97/better_basic_materials/\nhttps://content.minetest.net/packages/mt-mods/basic_materials/",
