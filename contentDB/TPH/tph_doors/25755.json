Docs in the works! (wanted to make a quick demo release to get feedback). No demonstrative doors provided - you can check commit history on the GIT for them though ;p\n\nI bring you my rendition at an overhaul of Minetest's doors system! A system that I personally dislike a lot - and wanted to see if I could rework from the ground up. Uses ONLY 2 nodes and tries to use meta calls as minimally as possible. No weird self object functionality either. Doors are pretty much fully functional already - any that you register with my mod.\n\nThis is intended to ease developer's woes with designing doors + adding a lot more customization and permitting more functionality and conditions. There's a lot more functions to your doors that you can specify such as the doors_interact callback and you now have the ability to use nodeboxes to make doors.\n\nI'm working on setting up conversion from Minetest Game's system to my own system as well - lots of success but not fully furnished and bugs not fully fleshed out. I haven't created a system for trapdoors just yet - but it's in the brain works :D\n\nHope you enjoy! Feedback - praise and criticism alike is greatly appreciated! I'd like to made my mod as accessible and easy to use as is possible","maintainers":["TPH"],"media_license":"MIT","name":"tph_doors","provides":["tph_doors"],"release":25755,"repo":"https://codeberg.org/TPH/tph_doors","score":4.4,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/d6583e06e8.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/c59d6b994a.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/db5285b55c.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/0c5284b01a.png"],"short_description":"(INTENDED FOR DEVELOPERS) Attempts to ease and better simplify door mechanics + registration","state":"APPROVED","tags":["library"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/d6583e06e8.png","title":"TPH's Doors API Redo","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/TPH/tph_doors/releases/25755/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"TPH/tph_doors":[]},"hash":"006kwi6skpi6xrvpawmc0r2zsssybgzc6i1i792m9w04a21jz27f"}
