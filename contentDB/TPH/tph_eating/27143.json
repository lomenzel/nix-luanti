Which has full support from my mod (for both v3 and v4):\nhttps://content.minetest.net/packages/Mantar/exile/\n\nYou can see my mod in action in Exile v4 on exile-dev.planetofnix.com:30016 aka \"Exiled From The Other Servers\"\n\n[Documentation (Codeberg)](https://codeberg.org/TPH/tph_eating/src/branch/master/api.md)\n\n\nThe video provided is hosted on catbox.moe (file hosting service): [https://files.catbox.moe/4oe107.mp4](https://files.catbox.moe/4oe107.mp4)\n\nHolding down RMB (or whatever tph_eating.use_key is set to for player:get_player_controls() ) will make you begin to eat the food with eating sounds and upon 4 (or how many repetitions specified in API or tool), will complete eating with a burp (unless tph_eating.burping is not set to true or a tool specifies a custom end sound)\n\nPseudo-animation for 5.4.0+ implemented (you will see your food infront of your face and it will move with your head ;p)\n\nMinetest 5.9 will have an issue with any version of this mod before 1.9 (spam of error logs)\n\nMinetest 5.0.1 and 5.1.0 have odd but non-gamebreaking issues and are considered \"compatible\". Minetest 5.2.0 and 5.3.0 do not properly display the wield_item entity however is otherwise operational. No issues with Minetest 5.4.0 and onwards",
