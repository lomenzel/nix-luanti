  "long_description": "*****Attention********\nBecause this is still a project for me to learn and improve my coding and design I have tried to move things to what I would assume is logical places and rename them to try and make things simpler. Because of this recently the updates don't update things properly so it is better to remove and then reinstall the game for it to work. \n\nMinegistics is a building game with logistics networks, power grids, towns and trains.\n\nIn your starting inventory you have collectors, power plant, rails, trains, a market, a town, and some coal.\n\nTo get resources you need to place a collector on top of a node and power it. \n(Collectors can collect wood from trees when placed next to a forest.)\n\nTo produce power you need to supply a power plant with coal or wood for fuel.\nBuildings within range of the power plant will be supplied with power.\nOpen your inventory and click the power button to see information about your power grid.\n\nTo make money, you will need to place a market and town and connect them together with rails and a train. \nSupply the market with goods from a collector, factory, workshop or farm. These items will be sold.\n\nThank you for all the interest and support I am striving to make it a better game and more towards my idea of a finished project. I am still currently activly working on it just at slower pace when I can find time in my busy life. Hope that you are all enjoying yourselves.\n\nFollow along with development in [the forum topic](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=27610)",
