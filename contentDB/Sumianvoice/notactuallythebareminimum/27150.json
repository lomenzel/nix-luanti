  "long_description": "# notactuallythebareminimum\nA blank slate for making new minetest games. You may re-license this however you like, build off it, do whatever. It was created explicitly with the intent of having people use it as a starting point, and as such you may claim ownership of any code within this project and you may remove the existing LICENSE and add your own LICENSE file or otherwise forego attribution. All rights to stop you doing stuff with this code are waived except the no warrantee and liability clauses of the LICENSE attached.\n\n## What is it for?\nIt is a base, nearly bare minimum game, just enough to be able to walk around on terrain. It also is structured in a sane way, with mod folders and files being called instead of everything being in `init.lua`. It also has some biomes and decorations and an example of crafting, and a hand override so you can dig.\n\n## Is it a playable game\nNo.\n\n## Why not use X or Y or Z instead\nThere are other projects that you could build off, but they all have licenses that, technically speaking, restrict your use of them and aren't a good way legally speaking to start a completely new, from scratch project. For example if a game is MIT licensed, even if you keep one line of the original code in your game, you're still bound by the license (depending on the interpretation of \"substantial portions\" as prescribed by \\[insert judge here\\]. It is advised to still look at how other games and mods do things so you can learn how to use the minetest API of course, since this really only has about 0.1% of the features available in minetest.",
