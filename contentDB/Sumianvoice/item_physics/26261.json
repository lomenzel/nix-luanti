It will still probably not crash the game, but it might have visual glitches or cause items to move in strange ways. Mineclone variants are in this category; to make it function perfectly with MCL would mean making it not work for other games, so it is left with some glitches present. It will work, but not 100% as intended.\n","maintainers":["Sumianvoice"],"media_license":"0BSD","name":"item_physics","provides":["item_physics"],"release":26261,"repo":"https://codeberg.org/SumianVoice/item_physics","score":1048.9,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/72bc3cc6b3.jpg"],"short_description":"Makes items lay flat on the ground and not spin.","state":"APPROVED","tags":["decorative"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/72bc3cc6b3.png","title":"Item Physics","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/Sumianvoice/item_physics/releases/26261/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"Sumianvoice/item_physics":[]},"hash":"0mfwmysw7im2j883rj2q2f96yjkhz24c6qb4wm9g1s77ncii4mg9"}
