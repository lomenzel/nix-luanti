There are three items added:\n\n* packed parachute which can be deployed mid air to safely descend\n* empty parachute bag\n* parachute material itself\n\nDepends on playerphysics, so make sure you have that installed!\n\n## Crafting\n[Crafting guide image](https://codeberg.org/SumianVoice/sum_parachute/raw/branch/main/crafting.png)\n\nCrafting relies on MTG or MCL for item names, but the actual parachute works regardless of game.\n\n* parachute bag = 7 x leather, 1 x string (or wool + string in MTG)\n* parachute material = 3 x (canvas / wool), 2 x string\n* parachute  = parachute material + parachute bag\n\nThe parachute is somewhat controllable. Think of it as a cheap, less convenient elytra. You can't take off from the ground with it, so it's only a safety measure such as on floatlands. \n\nShift to dismount, forward and backward and mouse to steer. \n\n## Air Currents\nThis also implements [sum_air_currents](https://codeberg.org/SumianVoice/sum_air_currents). In strong wind, the parachute is much harder to control if air currents are installed and enabled.","maintainers":["Sumianvoice"],"media_license":"CC-BY-4.0","name":"sum_parachute","provides":["sum_parachute"],"release":13377,"repo":"https://codeberg.org/SumianVoice/sum_parachute","score":324.2,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/1151038fe9.jpg","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/1a7d85107e.jpg"],"short_description":"Adds parachutes.
