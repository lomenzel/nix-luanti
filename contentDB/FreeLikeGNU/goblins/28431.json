  "long_description": "#  Goblins \n\nThis mod adds several Goblins (and Goblin Dogs) to several Minetest games that will spawn near ore deposits or lairs underground.\n\n## Compatibility\n\n*  Minetest Game (requires [Mobs Redo](https://content.minetest.net/packages/TenPlus1/mobs/))\n*   [VoxeLibre / MineClone 2](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/mineclone2/)\n*   [Mineclonia](https://content.minetest.net/packages/ryvnf/mineclonia/)\n*   [Hades Revisited](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=19121)\n*   [Repixture](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/repixture/) (requires [Mobs Redo](https://content.minetest.net/packages/TenPlus1/mobs/))\n*   [Asuna](https://content.minetest.net/packages/EmptyStar/asuna/) (requires [Mobs Redo](https://content.minetest.net/packages/TenPlus1/mobs/))\n## Features\n* NEW: Support for [Hades Revisited](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=19121) \nand  [Repixture](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/repixture/) \n* NEW: Goblin lairs are created when dungeons are enabled with a games map generator!\n* Goblins can learn what food is available from players from any food mod for MTG or MCx games.\n* Some Goblins have loot filled chests nearby! Can you befriend or defeat these goblins?\n* Goblins dig caves, destroy torches, create lairs, set traps, cultivate mushrooms and some are aggressive.\n* Gobdogs will roam caves, bury bones and other items in soft terrain, eat meats. Some Gobdogs are aggressive!\n* Basic trading with Goblins - the more you trade with a goblin, the more likely you will get things in return! \n* Goblins have a territorial framework for location based interactions, if you trade with more Goblins of a territory\n  your trades will be easier! \n* Harming goblins will negatively affect your trade with all gobins in a territory!  \n* If you brandish weapons (including axes) around a goblin it may decide to attack!\n* Goblins and Gobdogs will defend each other.  You can have them defend other mobs by simply\nadding to: \n`on_spawn = function(self)`\nthe following:\n`self.groups = {\"goblin_friend\", \"gobdog_friend\"}`\nin your own mobs definition!\n* There are many settings now accessible from the minetest menu -> \"settings\" tab -> \"all settings\" -> \"mods\" -> \"goblins\" list!\nthese can also be defined in the settingtypes.txt\n* Goblin and Gobdog spawning is now configured from goblins_spawning.lua (at least until there is a way to easily change these with the setting menu :P )\n* Goblin related follow and drop items now moved to mod_storage\n* Goblin spawning parameters moved to mod_storage\n* A basic and optional (enabled in minetest setting menu) HUD is available\n* tested with Minetest 5.4 and 5.70(dev)\n\n## Required Mods (only if using Minetest Game or Repixture):\n*  [Mobs Redo](https://content.minetest.net/packages/TenPlus1/mobs/) by TenPlus1 API as of version 20200516: to run. \n## Optional Mods:\n* [Ambience Lite](https://content.minetest.net/packages/TenPlus1/ambience/) by TenPlus1 API\n   \n* [https://content.minetest.net/packages/Linuxdirk/hunger_ng/](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Linuxdirk/hunger_ng/)Hunger NG by Linuxdirk\n \n* [Bonemeal](https://content.minetest.net/packages/TenPlus1/bonemeal/) by TenPlus1\n    \n## Licenses of Source Media Files:\n* goblins_goblin.b3d and goblins_goblin.blend \n    * Copyright 2015 by Francisco \"FreeLikeGNU\" Athens Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0)\n    * http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\n\n* above meshes based on character from minetest_game\n    * by MirceaKitsune (WTFPL)\n    * https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game/blob/master/mods/default/README.txt#L71\n\n* goblins_goblins*.png files and goblins_goblin.xcf files\n    * Copyright 2015,2020 by Francisco \"FreeLikeGNU\" Athens  Creative Commons  Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported \t\t(CC BY-SA 3.0) \n    * http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\n\n* goblins_goblin_dog.b3d and goblins_goblin_dog*.blend \n    * Copyright 2016,2020 by Francisco \"FreeLikeGNU\" Athens Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0)\n    * http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\n\n* goblins_goblin_dog*.png files and goblins_goblin_dog*_.xcf files\n    * Copyright 2015 by Francisco \"FreeLikeGNU\" Athens  Creative Commons  Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported         (CC BY-SA 3.0) \n    * http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\n    \n## Additional source and content credits:\n* goblin mushrooms from \"flowers\" mod source code:\n    * Originally by Ironzorg (MIT) and VanessaE (MIT)\n    * Various Minetest developers and contributors (MIT)\n* mushrooms.xcf Copyright Francisco Athens (CC BY-SA 3.0) 2020\n* goblins_mushroom_brown.png, goblins_mushroom_brown2.png goblins_mushroom_brown3.png goblins_mushroom_brown4.png Copyright Francisco Athens (CC BY-SA 3.0) 2020\n\n## Sound files by:\n * artisticdude http://opengameart.org/content/goblins-sound-pack (CC0-license)\n * Ogrebane http://opengameart.org/content/monster-sound-pack-volume-1 (CC0-license)\n * goblins_ambient_underground: 232685__julius-galla__atmosphere-cave-loop (CC-BY-SA)\n    * https://freesound.org/people/julius_galla/sounds/232685/\n * goblins_goblin_trap: LittleRobotSoundFactory  (CC-BY-SA)\n    * https://freesound.org/people/LittleRobotSoundFactory/\n * goblins_goblin_breathing: spookymodem \n    * https://freesound.org/people/spookymodem/ (CC-0)\n * goblins_goblin_dog_ sounds:\n     delphidebrain Jazz the Dog Howl & Bark (CC-BY-SA)\n       * https://freesound.org/people/delphidebrain/sounds/236027/\n * Glitchedtones Dog Shih Tzu Growling 06.wav (CC-BY-SA)\n       * https://freesound.org/people/Glitchedtones/sounds/372533/\n\n* Super thanks to duane-r for his work on nasty traps and tunneling  https://github.com/duane-r \n\n* Thanks to Napiophelios for the goblin king skin\n    * https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=13004#p186921\n    * goblins_goblin_king.png\n    * License: Creative Commons (CC-BY-SA-3.0 SummerFeilds TP\n  \n*  Thanks to orbea for adding Hunger NG and Bonemeal mod support and bugfixes!\n    * https://github.com/orbea\n* Thanks to TenPlus1 for keeping the Mobs_Redo going!\n* Thanks to rubenwardy for awesome help and the Minetest ContentDB\n* Thanks to everyone in the Minetest forums and IRC for just being great!\n* Thanks to kristovish for testing and providing crash reports from their live populated server!\n  ",
