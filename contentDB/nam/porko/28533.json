Lots of pigs. You vaguely recall a children's game you played many years ago. What was it called again? Something porcine, perhaps?\n\nSubmission for the 2024 Luanti Game Jam.\n\n## Instructions\n\nInstall like any other Luanti game.\n\nTo play, you must reach a score of 100 or more before the AI does, by rolling the die, or passing. If you roll anything but a one, great, you add it to your score, and keep rolling, or pass, if you wish. Otherwise, your score gets reset to where it was last at the start of your turn.\n","maintainers":["nam"],"media_license":"CC0-1.0","name":"porko","provides":["cblocks","default","dice2","digilines","dye","led_marquee","mesecons","mesecons_button","mesecons_gamecompat","mesecons_receiver","mobs","mobs_animal","porko_core"],"release":28533,"repo":"https://github.com/nmccamish/porko","score":-112.4,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/a999ae8591.png"],"short_description":"Porko, the Dice Game","state":"APPROVED","tags":["jam_game_2024","oneofakind__original","singleplayer","strategy_rts"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/a999ae8591.png","title":"Porko","translation_url":null,"type":"game","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/nam/porko/releases/28533/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"nam/porko":[]},"hash":"0z8x22jc2rkbp8aq2c2wrbdq85lbr392nn9jj5rl3b4lq008fclf"}
