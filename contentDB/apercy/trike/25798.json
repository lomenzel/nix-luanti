  "long_description": "Minetest 5.4 mod: Ultralight Trike\n========================================\n\nAs the title say, it's a flying machine\n\nThis one tries to implement some flight physics, using the mobkit mod.\nIn order to fly, it is necessary to first supply the aircraft with biofuel.\nThen with a bottle of biofuel selected, punch it against the trike.\nYou can use 10 of them to fill the tank. See the fuel gauge on the aircraft\npanel (right below, with a green F). To go onboard, click with the right button.\nWhile the machine is off, it is possible to move it using the sneak and jump keys (shift an space).\nW ans S move the wing, to increase and decrease the attack angle (it's important).\nRight and Left (A and D) controls the yaw.\n\nThen to fly, start the engine with the special key E. Press jump (space)\nto increase the engine power (check the panel for the indicator marked with a yellow P).\nAdjust to the maximum. Push the wing (W) and wait for speed to lift.\n\nDuring the cruise flight, it is ideal to keep the power setting below the red range,\nto control fuel consumption. Use the climb indicator to stabilize altitude,\nas at high altitudes you lose support and you spend more fuel. \n\nFor landing, a traffic circuit can be made, lowering the power and increasing \nthe angle of attack of the wing to reduce speed and altitude (acting as a flap). \nOr to force the descent by pulling the wing and pushing it forward when \napproaching, regulating the speed. \n\nCare must be taken with impacts, as it causes damage to the aircraft and the pilot, \nso training landings is essential. \n\nTo brake the aircraft, use the sneak (shift) key until it comes to a complete stop.\nDo not stop the engine before this, or it will reverse when it stops \n\nThe trike has an inventory with 3 slots, that can be accessed holding E and a right click\n\nTo repair damages, you can use the repair tool. It subtracts steel ingots to increase\nairplane hp.\n\nIt can be painted using dye of any color you want, you must punch the airplane with the dye.\n\nIf you do not desire the biofuel mod from Lokrates, here another biofuel mod can be found: https://github.com/APercy/minetest_biofuel\n\n-----------------------\nLicense of source code:\nLGPL v3 (see file LICENSE) \n\n---------------------------------------\nLicense of media (textures, models and sounds):\nCC0\n\n",
