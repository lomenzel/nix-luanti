  "long_description": "Minetest 5.4 mod: Steampunk Blimp\n========================================\n\nNote: update the **airutils** lib first\n\nNote 2: not designed for potato server\n\nNote 2023/12/21: Now the logo formspec let the player use any texture loaded in the game\n\nThis mod implements a fantasy steampunk blimp for minetest.\nThe mod was made for fun, but tries to provide an immersion on it's operation.\nIt can carry 7 players.\n\nTo fly it, it is necessary to provide some items, such as fuel to be burned and\nwater for the boiler. The fuel can be coal, coal block and wood. To supply it,\nbe on board and punch the necessary items on the airship. There is another way to\nload water to the boiler: if it is landed on water, it can load it through the\nmenu. But the current pressure will be lost.\n\nActivate the furnace in the first option of the menu. Take control by activating\nthe option \"Take the Control\".\n\nThe information panel will be on the left and bottom of the screen. Wait for the\nboiler to reach the proper pressure for operation (green) before operating the power lever.\nTo go up, press Jump (space). Note that it takes some pressure from the boiler. To go down,\nhold sneak (shift).\n\nForward increases the propeller power, Backward reduces. To go reverse, hold aux (E key)\nand backward together. There is a power mode. When the lever reaches the up limit, hold E\nand forward to increase the acceleration. But note that the boiler will lose pressure.\n\nThe blimp inventory can be accessed by Aux (E) + rightclick.\n\n\n**Shared owners:**\n\n* This vehicle was made to be shared with a team. So the owner can set more users to  operate it. Inside the blimp, just use the command /blimp_share <name>\n* To remove someone from the sharing, /blimp_remove <name>\n* To list the owners, /blimp_list\n* Is possible to lock the blimp access, so only the owners can enter: /blimp_lock true\n* To let anyone enter, /blimp_lock false\n* All shared owners can access the blimp inventory\n\n\t\n**Painting:**\n\t\n* As the planes, punch a dye against the hull, so the primary color will change\n* To change the secondary color, punch a dye, but holding Aux (E) key.\n* It is possible to set a logo on your blimp, so enter inside it and type the command /blimp_logo\n* Only the original owner can do the paintings\n* To paint it on Repixture game, the owner have to use the command /blimp_paint\n\n\t\n**Shortcuts:**\n\t\n* right click to enter and access menu\n* punch with dye to paint\n* forward and backward while in drive position: controls the power lever\n* left and right while in drive position: controls the direction\n* jump and sneak: controls the up and down movement\n* E + right click while inside: acess inventory\n* E + backward while in drive position: the machine does backward\n* E + foward while in drive position: extra power\n\n\t\n**Tip:**\n\t\n* Drive it gently.\n* The captain can leave the drive position to walk too\n* If a player goes timeout or logoff in flight, the blimp will \"rescue\" him if no other player enter the blimp, so is a good idea wait the friend at a secure place far from anyone who wants to enter the blimp.\n\n\t\n**Know issues:**\n\t\n* The walk movement inside the ship is affected by server lag, because the lack of an interpolation method on attach function.\n* Rubber-band bug is from minetest nature, just close and reopen minetest to solve. Or try to live the Michael Jackson's way of life and learn the Moonwalk properly XD\n* Some old versions of minetest can have an strange issue, the camera is set to the map center. So if it happens, just type /blimp_eject to be free again.\n\n\nLicense of source code:\nMIT (see file LICENSE) \n\nLicense of media (textures and sounds):\n---------------------------------------\ncollision.ogg by APercy, CC0\n\nBlimp model and textures by APercy.
