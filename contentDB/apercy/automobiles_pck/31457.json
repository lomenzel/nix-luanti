  "long_description": "# automobiles\n\nModpack to add automobiles to minetest\n\ndepends:\nbiofuel,mobkit\n\nThe main goal of this modpack is the detection of slopes and elevations by the vehicles, so the expected is for the vehicle to follow them.\nThe collision will still be improved as the engine is also improved, so don't demand so much.\nFor the vehicle operation, fuel is needed, although it will always start with some. You can install the Lokrate's Biofuel mod to make some fuel. Or at last instance, install Airutils mod to have a fuel distiler used by the airplanes.\nWhen playing \"Drift Game\", the cars don't use any fuel, and some cars are inserted into player's inventory automatically.\n\n\n\nNow with inventory\n\nW: Forward\n\nS: Brake\n\nA: Left\n\nD: Right\n\nE: Horn\n\nShift: Reverse (or goes down on Delorean Time Machine when flying)\n\nE + right click (from outside): car inventory\n\nSpace (Jump): Delorean Time Machine goes up\n\nWhen the box \"Drive with mouse\" is turned on, the driver can drive it with mouse movements.\n\nIt can be painted by punching dye on it. Or the painter.\nAnd fueled by punching biofuel\n\n**Special Privs:**\n\nvalet_parking\n\n- Gives a valet parking priv for a player\n\n**Chat Commands:**\n\n/transfer_vehicle player_name\n\n- Transfer the ownership of the vehicle. You must be on the vehicle to perform the command\n\n**SettingTypes:**\n\ncollect_automobiles true/false\n- The vehicles can be collected again after its destruction\n\nnoob_mode false/true\n- Enable an ease mode for vehicle usage, the vehicle will climb entire blocks\n\n\nPS: The Time Machine version of the Delorean does not have recipe.\n\nPS2: To disable character animation while riding motorcycles, use the option \"motorcycle_anim_mode = false\". The animations only works correctly on Luanti versions equal or above 5.11. Using the option will solve older versions strange positions.",
