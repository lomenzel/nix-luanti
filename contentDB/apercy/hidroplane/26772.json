  "long_description": "Minetest 5.4 mod: Hydroplane - Super Duck\n========================================\n\nThe Super Duck\n\nThis one tries to implement some flight, using the mobkit mod.\nIn order to fly, it is necessary to first supply the airplane with biofuel.\nThen with a bottle or gallon selected, punch it against the airplane floater.\nYou can use 10 bottles them to fill the tank. See the fuel gauge on the airplane\npanel (right below, with a green F). To embark, click with the right button.\nWhile the machine is off, it is possible to move it using the sneak and jump keys (shift an space).\nW ans S controls the pitch (elevator).\nRight and Left (A and D) controls the yaw (rudder and ailerons).\n\nThen to fly, start the engine with the special key E. Press jump (space)\nto increase the engine power (check the panel for the indicator marked with a yellow P).\nAdjust to the maximum. Pull the elevator control (S) when it have the speed to lift.\n\nDuring the cruise flight, it is ideal to keep the power setting below the red range,\nto control fuel consumption. Use the climb indicator to stabilize altitude,\nas at high altitudes you lose sustentation and you spend more fuel. \n\nFor landing, just lower the power and stabilize the airplane. Pay attention at air speed\nindicator, keeping it at green range, otherwise you will stall.\n\nCare must be taken with impacts, as it causes damage to the aircraft and the pilot, \nso training landings is essential. \n\nTo brake the airplane, use the sneak (shift) key until it comes to a complete stop.\nDo not stop the engine before this, or it will reverse when it stops \n\nTo repair damages, you can use the repair tool. It subtracts steel ingots to increase\nairplane hp.\n\nIt can be painted using dye of any color you want, you must punch the airplane with the dye.\n\nBiofuel mod can be found here: https://github.com/APercy/minetest_biofuel\n\n**Controls overview :**\n\n- Right click: enter in/get off plane\n- Left click (with biofuel): add fuel to plane\n- Right click and Sneak: enter in flight instructor mode (limited vision, so use debug info)\n- E: Start engine\n- Jump: Increase power, forward on ground\n- Sneak: Decrease power, brake on ground\n- Backward: go up flying - nose up\n- Forward: go down flying - nose down\n- Left/right: Turn to left/right, work on and out ground.\n- Left and Right together: center all commands\n- Sneak and Jump together (normal mode): activates de autopilot\n- Sneak and Jump together (instruction mode): give/take the controls to/from pilot student\n- Up and Down together: enable/disable HUD\n\n**Chat Commands:**\n\n /hydro_eject - ejects from the vehicle\n \n /hydro_manual - shows the manual\n\n\n**Don't forget:**\n\nUpdate the lib airutils in your minetest, it's important, all flight functions depends on airutils\n\n**Some Considerations About Servers:**\n\nThe mod is running since the development start at Mercurio Server. The mod requires average performance to fly satisfactorily. But consider adjusting the dedicated_server_step parameter so that the behavior is more fluid. it will operate with the default setting of 0.1, the ideal value being 0.01 (but this would consume a lot of resources). Then experiment with values between 0.05 to 0.09, in order to achieve the best performance within the existing limitations. Or don't touch anything, they are just suggestions. \n\n\n\n-----------------------\nLicense of source code:\nLGPL v3 (see file LICENSE) \n\nLicense of media (textures and sounds):\nCC0\n\n\n",
