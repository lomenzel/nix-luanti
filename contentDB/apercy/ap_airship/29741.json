  "long_description": "Minetest 5.4 mod: Airship\n========================================\n\nThis mod implements an airship for minetest. This airship is affected by the wind. The wind better works\nwith Climate API (and with climate API you can stop it using /set_wind 0 0 )\n\nTHIS IS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL AND HAVE A LOT OF MISSING FEATURES. AND I KNOW IT\n\nTHE COLLISION SYSTEM IS VERY RUDIMENTARY\n\nThe fuel system isn't exists yet, so I don't recomend giving it to players yet if you put it into a server\n\n**Shortcuts:**\nforward and backward while in drive position: controls the power lever\nleft and right while in drive position: controls the direction\njump and sneak: controls the up and down movement\n\n- right click into the external stair to enter it\n- E + backward while in drive position: the machine does backward\n- E + foward while in drive position: extra power\n- right click into drive wheel to activate pilot menu\n- right click into the internal ladders to go out\n- right click into any seat to sit your player\n- the anchor only works when the airship is near stoped\n\nRemembering AGAIN, it is affected by winds, so it will need patience to learn to control\n\n**Tip:**\nDrive it gently.\nThe captain can leave the drive position to walk too\nIf a player goes timeout or logoff in flight, the airship will \"rescue\" him if no other player\nenter it, so is a good idea wait the friend at a secure place far from anyone who\nwants to enter the airship.\n\n**Special functions:**\n/external_attach_menu\n- it opens the menu to attach a plane into the airship (who watched Indiana Jones and The Last Cruzade\n  will understand)\n  to access the plane during the flight, go to the ladder at the end of the airship and right click it\n  to release the plane during the flight, use /remove_hook (BEWARE: the airship have to be moving fast\n  and the plane power have to be at 1/4 to avoid collision and death (for the plane pilot))\nThere is an option on pilot menu to activate the rescue mode. So if a plane (Supercub, Camel or Albatroz)\nwait bellow the ship belly IN FLIGHT, it will be automatically hooked after 3 seconds\n\n\n**Know issues:**\nThe walk movement inside the ship is affected by server lag, because the lack of\nan interpolation method on attach function.\n  \nLicense of source code:\nMIT (see file LICENSE) \n\nLicense of media (textures and sounds):\n---------------------------------------\nAirship model and textures by APercy.
