  "long_description": "Minetest 5.4 mod: PA28\n========================================\n\nThe PA28\n\nFirst: update the Airutils mod.\n\nThis is an implementarion to minetest of the Piper PA28. It is far from the real\nplane, as it is adapted to a minetest scale and behaviour. It was inspired on\nbrazilian version of it, the EMB-712 Tupi.\nIn order to fly, it is necessary to first supply the airplane with biofuel.\nThen with a bottle or gallon selected, punch it against the airplane.\nYou can use 10 bottles them to fill the tank. See the fuel gauge on the airplane\npanel (right below, with a green F). To embark, click with the right button.\nWhile the machine is off, it is possible to move it using the sneak and jump keys (shift an space).\nW ans S controls the pitch (elevator).\nRight and Left (A and D) controls the yaw (rudder and ailerons).\n\nThen to fly, start the engine accessing the internal menu (right click). Press jump (space)\nto increase the engine power (check the panel for the indicator marked with a P).\nAdjust to the maximum. Pull the elevator control (S) when it have the speed to lift.\n\nDuring the cruise flight, it is ideal to keep the power setting below the red range,\nto control fuel consumption. Use the climb indicator to stabilize altitude,\nas at high altitudes you lose sustentation and you spend more fuel.\n\nThe altimeter was adapted too for a minetest range, so instead an altimeter divided by\n1000 feets, it is divided in 100ft only\n\nFor landing, just lower the power and stabilize the airplane. Pay attention at air speed\nindicator, keeping it at green range, otherwise you will stall. It is recommended to use\nthe flap during landing, but it should only be engaged when the speed is at the initial\nlimit of the green range, as it will automatically retract if the speed exceeds too much.\n\nCare must be taken with impacts, as it causes damage to the aircraft and the pilot, \nso training landings is essential. \n\nTo brake the aircraft, use the sneak (shift) key until it comes to a complete stop.\nDo not stop the engine before this, or it will reverse when it stops \n\nTo repair damages, you can use the repair tool. It subtracts steel ingots to increase\nairplane hp.\n\nIt can be painted using dye of any color you want, you must punch the airplane with the dye.\nIt is possible to paint it using the automobiles or the bike painter if it is installed\n\nYou can use biofuel mod made by Lokrates, but here I have another biofuel mod:\nhttps://github.com/APercy/minetest_biofuel\n\nThe limitations: because the lack in functions to roll the camera, and the rudder acting together the ailerons,\nthe airplane is unable to do a tuneau, barrel roll, loopings and any kind of aerobatics maneuvers. \n\n**Controls overview:**\n\n\n* Right click: enter in/get off plane\n\n* Left click (with biofuel): add fuel to plane\n\n* Right click and Sneak: enter in flight instructor mode (limited vision, so use debug info)\n\n* Aux1 + Sneak: flaps\n\n* Jump: Increase power, forward on ground\n\n* Sneak: Decrease power, brake on ground\n\n* Backward: go up flying - nose up\n\n* Forward: go down flying - nose down\n\n* Left/right: Turn to left/right, work on and out ground.\n\n* Left + Right: center all commands\n\n* Sneak + Jump: autopilot\n\n* Aux1 + Jump: pass the control to copilot \n\n* Up + Down: enable/disable HUD\n\n**Chat Commands: **\n\n/pa28_eject - ejects from the vehicle\n\n/pa28_manual - shows the manual\n\n-----------------------\nLicense of source code:\nLGPL v3 (see file LICENSE) \n\nLicense of media (textures and sounds):\nCC0\n\n\n",
