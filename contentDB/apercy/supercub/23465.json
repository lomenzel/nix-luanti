  "long_description": "Super Cub\n========================================\n\nThe Super Cub\n\nThis is a pure lithoplane, based on Super Cub airplane.\nIn order to fly, it is necessary to first supply the airplane with biofuel.\nThen with a bottle or gallon selected, punch it against the airplane.\nYou can use 10 bottles them to fill the tank. See the fuel gauge on the airplane\npanel (right below, with a green F). To embark, click with the right button.\nWhile the machine is off, it is possible to move it using the sneak and jump keys (shift an space).\nW ans S controls the pitch (elevator).\nRight and Left (A and D) controls the yaw (rudder and ailerons).\n\nThen to fly, start the engine using the plane menu (right click). Press jump (space)\nto increase the engine power (check the panel for the indicator marked with a yellow P).\nAdjust to the maximum. Pull the elevator control (S) when it have the speed to lift.\n\nDuring the cruise flight, it is ideal to keep the power setting below the red range,\nto control fuel consumption. Use the climb indicator to stabilize altitude,\nas at high altitudes you lose sustentation and you spend more fuel. \n\nFor landing, just lower the power and stabilize the airplane. Pay attention at air speed\nindicator, keeping it at green range, otherwise you will stall.\n\nCare must be taken with impacts, as it causes damage to the aircraft and the pilot, \nso training landings is essential. \n\nTo brake the aircraft, use the sneak (shift) key until it comes to a complete stop.\nDo not stop the engine before this, or it will reverse when it stops \n\nTo repair damages, you can use the repair tool. It subtracts steel ingots to increase\nairplane hp.\n\nIt can be painted using dye of any color you want, you must punch the airplane with the dye.\n\nBiofuel mod can be found here: https://github.com/APercy/minetest_biofuel\n\nThe limitations: because the lack in functions to roll the camera, and the rudder acting together the ailerons,\nthe airplane is unable to do a tuneau, barrel roll, loopings and any kind of aerobatics maneuvers. \nIt was limited at the source. You can modify it by your own, just making the roll movement cumulative and increasing the speeds\n\n**Controls overview:**\n* Right click: enter in/get off plane\n* Left click (with biofuel): add fuel to plane\n* Right click and Sneak: enter in flight instructor mode (limited vision, so use debug info)\n* E: Start engine\n* Jump: Increase power, forward on ground\n* Sneak: Decrease power, brake on ground\n* Backward: go up flying - nose up\n* Forward: go down flying - nose down\n* Left/right: Turn to left/right, work on and out ground.\n* Left and Right together: center all commands\n* Sneak and Jump together: give/take the controls to/from pilot student\n* Up and Down together: enable/disable HUD\n\n**Chat Commands: **\n\n/cub_eject - ejects from the vehicle\n\n/cub_manual - shows the manual\n\n-----------------------\nLicense of source code:\nLGPL v3 (see file LICENSE) \n\nLicense of media (textures and sounds):\nCC0\n\n\n",
