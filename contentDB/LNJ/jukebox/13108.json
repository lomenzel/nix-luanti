You need 8 wood and 1 mese crystal to craft it following way:\n\n```\nwood      wood      wood\nwood  mese crystal  wood\nwood      wood      wood\n```\n\nJust rightclick with a music disc in your hand on the jukebox and it will play a random song from this disc.\nTo stop the music rightclick the box again and it will drop the music disc.\n\n\n## API Documentation\nThe jukebox mod offers a simple API to register new discs. See here how to use it:\n\n```lua\njukebox.register_disc(\"mymod:new_disc\", {\n\tdescription = \"New Disc\",\n\t-- ^ The item description\n\tinventory_image = \"mymod_new_disc.png\",\n\t-- ^ The disc image / texture\n\tmusic_name = \"mymod_new_disc\",\n\t-- ^ This is the sound that'll be played if you insert the disc\n\t \n\t-- if you want to you can add here more options as in minetest.register_craftitem (except stack_max)\n})\n```\n\n\n\n## Links\n- [Forum Topic](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?id=13505)\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/minetest-mods/jukebox)\n","maintainers":["LNJ"],"media_license":"WTFPL","name":"jukebox","provides":["jukebox"],"release":13108,"repo":"https://github.com/minetest-mods/jukebox","score":8.6,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/ccb7f84665.png"],"short_description":"A mod that adds a jukebox with nine different discs.","state":"APPROVED","tags":["sound_music"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/ccb7f84665.png","title":"Müzik Kutusu","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/LNJ/jukebox/releases/13108/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"LNJ/jukebox":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"default","packages":["AiTechEye/xaenvironment","Hi_World/newplanet","Noodlemire/voxeldungeon","JALdMIC/survivethedays","sunnysideup/holidayhorrors","BuckarooBanzay/mesecons_lab","nam/porko","Amaz/lordofthetest","1248/castrum","Thunder1035/etb","1248/regnum","Minetest/minetest_game","debiankaios/proxima_survival","carlos_rupp/berzerkpt","1248/regnum2","miroptics/qiskitblocks_miro","KareaGhandTrail/block_assault_mapmaker","KareaGhandTrail/block_assault","Casimir/voxelgarden","bell07/whynot_game","JavaFXpert/qiskitblocks","Kimapr/nonsensical_skyblock","jgordon510/gridlocks","giga-turbo/codecube","niwla23/runorfall","Thunder1035/pacman","Big_Caballito/no_mans_land","MeseCraft/mesecraft","hilol/epic_combat","TheFanne/raining_nodes","rlars/occupymoon_game","PetiAPocok/minetest_extended","mooD_Slayer/ksurvive","EmptyStar/asuna","mt-mods/dreambuilder_game","rubenwardy/capturetheflag"]}]},"hash":"13dmzwjfl9xz82shmqfr6yxybvybw781xcvvycxdsvynh5xspx0a"}
