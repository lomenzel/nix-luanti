  "long_description": "# More Curves\n\nMore Curves for [Luanti](https://www.luanti.org/), a free and open source infinite\nworld block sandbox game.\n\n# How to Use\n\n- Minetest Game and Mineclone based - craft a band saw\n- Band saw explanation\n- Supported Nodes in these games\n- How to add support for new nodes\n- screwdriver rotation specialty for the reversed 1,2,3 heights (pending)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Download the mod\n\nTo install More Curves, clone this Git repository into your Luanti's `mods/`\ndirectory:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/exevirus/morecurves.git\n```\n\nYou can also\n[download a ZIP archive](https://github.com/ExeVirus/morecurves/releases)\nof More Curves.\n\n### Enable the mod\n\nOnce you have installed More Curves, you need to enable it in Luanti.\nThe procedure is as follows:\n\n#### Using the client's main menu\n\nThis is the easiest way to enable More Curves when playing in singleplayer\n(or on a server hosted from a client).\n\n1. Start Luanti and switch to the **Local Game** tab.\n2. Select the world you want to enable More Curves in.\n3. Click **Configure**, then enable `morecurves` by double-clicking it\n   (or ticking the **Enabled** checkbox).\n4. Save the changes, then start a game on the world you enabled More Curves on.\n5. More Curves should now be running on your world.\n\n#### Using a text editor\n\nThis is the recommended way to enable the mod on a server without using a GUI.\n\n1. Make sure Luanti is not currently running (otherwise, it will overwrite\n   the changes when exiting).\n2. Open the world's `world.mt` file using a text editor.\n3. Add the following line at the end of the file:\n\n```text\nload_mod_morecurves = true\n```\n\nIf the line is already present in the file, then replace `false` with `true`\non that line.\n\n4. Save the file, then start a game on the world you enabled More Curves on.\n5. More Curves should now be running on your world.\n\n## Version compatibility\n\nMore Curves is currently primarily tested with Minetest 5.7.0.\nIt may or may not work with newer or older versions. Issues arising in older\nversions than 5.0.0 will generally not be fixed.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright Â© 2025 ExeVirus\n\n- More Curves code and models are licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, see\n  [`LICENSE.md`](https://github.com/ExeVirus/morecurves/blob/master/LICENSE.md) for details.\n\n- More Curves is directly inspired and derivative of [More Blocks](https://github.com/minetest-mods/moreblocks/), \n  which is lisensed under the [Zlib License](https://www.zlib.net/zlib_license.html)\n",
