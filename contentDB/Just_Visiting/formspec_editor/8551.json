(You can also specify a file location with the `formspec_editor.file_path` setting.)\nSimply add the game to MT, load up a level of *Formspec Editor*, and you will be greeted with the formspec. \n\n- To make edits, open the file in your editor of choice and make changes as you see fit. When you hit save, the formspec will auto-update. Best when used side by side. \n- To exit just hit <escape> or use a button_exit[] button. Both send the\nfields.quit message.\n- You can test with images if you want, adding a \"textures\" folder to the \nformspec_edit gamemod folder, otherwise images will default to random colors.\n- You can show the formspec with builtin, minetest_game or mineclone2 styling (see the `formspec_editor.style` setting)\n- You can change the refresh rate by changing the `formspec_editor.update_time` setting\n","maintainers":["Just_Visiting"],"media_license":"MIT","name":"formspec_editor","provides":["formspec_edit"],"release":8551,"repo":"https://github.com/ExeVirus/formspec_editor","score":782.5,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/91324ef4f9.png"],"short_description":"A Realtime in-game formspec viewer/editor","state":"APPROVED","tags":["developer_tools","gui"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/91324ef4f9.png","title":"Formspec Editor","translation_url":null,"type":"game","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/Just_Visiting/formspec_editor/releases/8551/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"Just_Visiting/formspec_editor":[]},"hash":"0lb7kfn497ij9w7xzvkfr6nvs6qy5pl9px82daxx13i1878biw2d"}
