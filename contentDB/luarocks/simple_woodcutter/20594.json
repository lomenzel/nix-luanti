  "long_description": "# Simple Woodcutter\n\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minetestia/simple-woodcutter/main/screenshot.gif)\n\nThis mod chops the whole tree if you are holding an axe.\n\nThe chopping process stops if:\n\n- You are too far away from the target (40 blocks by default)\n- You take the axe out of your hand\n- Your axe is destroyed\n- You are dead\n- You are out of the game\n-  You are holding `ctrl` or `shift` key down (this behavior can be reversed in\n  settings)\n\n## Features\n\n- Super simple (~50 lines of code with extra features, translations and settings, but core functionality is just 10-15 lines).\n- Compatible with any game or mod\n- Works fine with huge trees\n- Recognizes trees and tools by their group, so it does not require any\n  configuration\n- If you don't have the `lumberjack` permission (in multiplayer game), trees will\n  be cut 100 times slower (you can change the default `delay` in settings)\n\n## Latest update notes\n\nSince version `1.2.0`, chopping trees is performed with a new, more accurate\nalgorithm that handles trees of all sizes and shapes! ðŸŽ‰\n\n---\n\nThis mod was created in [Rustroot Forge].\n\nAll my mods uses [Luanti LSP-API] annotations, [StyLua] and [Luacheck].\n\n[Rustroot Forge]: https://notabug.org/rr\n[Luanti LSP-API]: https://notabug.org/rr/luanti_lsp_api\n[StyLua]: https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua\n[Luacheck]: https://github.com/mpeterv/luacheck\n",
