  "long_description": "This mod features realistic trains and various equipment for railways, with a focus on automated train operation.\n\nMain features:\n\n- Almost-realistic tracks with actual curves and switches\n- Railway signals, controllable by various means\n- ATC: Simple, command-like automatic train control\n- LuaATC: Powerful Lua-scripted automatic train operation(requires some programming knowledge)*\n- An Interlocking system, featuring track sections, routes and automatic stopping before signals\n\nPlease note that the base modpack does not include any trains. Please see the [Train Catalogue](https://advtrains.de/wiki/doku.php?id=usage:trains:start)\n\n[General user manual](https://advtrains.de/manual)\n\n[Guide for the interlocking system](https://advtrains.de/interlocking)\n\n[Wiki](http://advtrains.de/wiki/)\n\n**Distant Signalling Update**\n\n2.5.0 releases the changes from the route_prog_rework branch. This brings the following new features:\n\n* Greatly improved user experience when creating interlocking routes\n* More checking and automatic repair of interlocking setups\n* Distant signalling support\n* New signals: Japanese signals and Munich U-Bahn signals which should replace the old wall signals\n* ATC command G waits for green signal ahead\n\n**Please note:**\n\nThis version introduces changes to the interlocking save data which are not backwards-compatible. You will not be able to directly downgrade to older advtrains versions again.\n\nFor your safety, advtrains saves the last version of the interlocking save file before the upgrade for you. If you want to downgrade advtrains after a world has been started with advtrains 2.5, please observe the following steps:\n\n* Install the older advtrains version\n* Open the world directory\n* Rename the file \"advtrains_interlocking.ls\" to \"advtrains_interlocking.ls.post250\" (you can restore it if something goes wrong)\n* Copy \"advtrains_interlocking.ls.pre250\" to \"advtrains_interlocking.ls\"\n* Start Luanti and load the world\n\nAlso note the following:\n\n* You need to enable the new signal mods for them to become visible\n* To continue to use Linetrack, if you were previously using Hume2's original version, please update to https://content.luanti.org/packages/Emojiminetest/linetrack/ (thanks Emojiminetest for porting it)\n\nThe documentation on the advtrains wiki or the manuals is not updated yet. For an introduction, please see the videos at http://advtrains.de/videos/ for now.\n",
