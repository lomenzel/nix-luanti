  "long_description": "Imagine you are 'alice' and want to send a PM to 'bob' and 'charlie'.\n\nThe normal way to do this would be:\n\n`/msg bob Hey, check out my new house!`\n\n`/msg charlie Hey, check out my new house!`\n\nUsing this mod makes it a lot easier: just write:\n\n`@bob,charlie Hey, check out my new house!`\n\nBob and Charlie will then see something like\n\n`(alice) Hey, check out my new house!`\n\nLater, whenever you want to send a message to Bob and Charlie again, or whoever is the last person(s) you *sent* a message to, just use:\n\n`@ Isn't it cool?`\n\nNote: using a ':' instead of the space behind the receiver list will also work. However, you should not put spaces inside the player list.",
