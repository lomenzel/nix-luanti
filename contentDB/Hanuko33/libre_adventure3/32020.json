  "long_description": "Based of Minetest Classic.\nIntends to make a simple game, that is similar to the minecraft golden age (Alpha/Beta).\n\nUNMAINTAINED, DROPPED.\n\nAfter playing a bit of luanti with MTG, Mineclonia, VoxeLibre (or just on servers), I've realized that I shouldn't recreate minecraft. Minecraft should recreate luanti.\nI highly recommend anyone to just do a deepdive into how luanti really is, not just play minecraft with different physics and texturepack.\n\nMTG already is golden age improved, but IMPROVED (in caps).\n\nI'll shift my focus to my other projects (non-luanti ones), or to making mods. Why should I recreate (or copy) things that already exist, when I can just make mods with the things I'm craving? Why should I waste my precious time to recreate a suboptimal experience? Why should bother making something worse, trying to recreate something worse?\n\nWhy Should I Recreate Minecraft,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen better things exist?",
