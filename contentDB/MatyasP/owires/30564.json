  "long_description": "Overhead wires is a mod by MatyasP, adds colorable overhead wires and masts and \nsupports for it.\nMod is created for Advanced Trains railways (supports Advtrains Moreslopes) but\ntechnically don't need AdvTrains.\nFor repaint of wires provides Repainter tool, for rotating provides Rotator tool\nbut you can use too screwdriver or WorldEdit. \nUsing rotator: left click - rotating by 1\nUsing repainter: left click - change color by 1, right click - change color by 8\n\nActually isn't specific tool for simpliest or automated placing more of overhead\nwires at once or replace wires by other type, for example left junction to right\njunction. You can use only World Edit, Edit or similar tools for fill an area or \ncopying nodes.\n\nColors: aren't used 10 latest colors in colorpalette - you can edit it and \nuse colors own!\nWhy more colors? You can use it as \"copper wires\", \"steel wires\", you can use it\nfor planning the railways...\nWhen you destroy some node, you will get to inventory with the same color.\n\nCrafting: mod creator isn't good in survival. When somebody create and share \ncrafting recipes, I will be happy!\n\nLicense:\n1 px texture \"bpx.png\" and palette are under the CC0. Textures of Reapinter and \nRotator are under the CC-BY 4.0 International. Code is under the MIT License.\n\n(Everybody knows that everybody needs 1 px texture of #ffffff white color\nto have licensed under the CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 :D)\n\n-------------\nKNOWED ISSUES:\n1st) Mod creator has a procrastination for update and upgrade of\nNoderoads and Nodehouses for a long time.\n2nd) Last parts of longer slopes have invisible icon in inventory.\n",
