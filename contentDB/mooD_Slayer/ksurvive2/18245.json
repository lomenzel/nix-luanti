This is currently in (semi) active development.\n\n\n\nThis game works quite differently from other Minetest games in terms of gameplay and crafting. As such, it is very difficult to play. I am working on a wiki on GitHub to help out players. The starting guide on the wiki can be found at this link:\nhttps://github.com/MadKamel/ksurvive-revival/wiki/Starting-Guide",
