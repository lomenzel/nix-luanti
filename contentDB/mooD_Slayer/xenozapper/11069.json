  "long_description": "\"Cattle prod but for *alien* cattle.\" -Warr1024\n\n# Xeno-Zapper\nThe Xeno-Zapper is an electroshock self-defense weapon used in self-defense against hostile alien fauna within close melee range.\n\n# Xeno-Basher (After version 0.9.1)\nThe Xeno-Basher is an improved version of the Zapper used for extended melee range. It deals much more damage, but is more expensive to make.\n\n# What are these weapons?\nThese weapons are remakes of the Xeno-Zapper and Xeno-Basher from the game Satisfactory. I thought that they would be fun to recreate, so I did so.\n\nInformation about the original weapons can be found on the Satisfactory wiki:\nhttps://satisfactory.fandom.com/wiki/Xeno-Zapper\nhttps://satisfactory.fandom.com/wiki/Xeno-Basher",
