  "long_description": "Regrowing Fruits\n===\n\nInfo\n---\n\nThis mod causes fruits on trees from various other mods to regrow like apples in the 5.0 release of Minetest Game. It also offers a small API to add fruit regrowth quickly.\nIf the fruit was placed by hand or the tree was chopped down, the fruit won't grow back. There is also a small chance that regrowth will stop randomly, so trees will bear less fruit over time.\n\nCurrently supported mods/modpacks are: `default`, `ethereal`, `cool_trees`, `moretrees`, `farming_plus`, `multibiomegen`, `australia` and `aotearoa`. \n\nThe standard regrowth time can be changed in settings (`min_regrow_interval` and `max_regrow_interval`) as well as the chance of regrowth stopping (`regrowth_stop_chance`).\n\nIdeas, bug reports or requests for more mod support are always welcome in the [Minetest Forum topic](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=24986) or via the [Git Issue Tracker](https://git.sp-codes.de/minetest/regrowing_fruits/issues)!\n\nAPI\n----\n\nThe `regrowing_fruits.add()` function overrides the fruits `after_dig_node` function and registers a placeholder node that will be placed once the fruit is taken and regrows the fruit after a timer expires.\n\n**Definition:**\n```\nregrowing_fruits.add(fruitname, leafname, param2, multiplier)\n```\n\n* `fruitname`: nodename of the fruit to be added.\n* `leafname`: nodename of the corresponding leaves (used as a reference whether tree is still alive).\n* `param2`: param2 value of fruit when placed naturally (not by player). Defaults to 0; -1 disables param2 checks for fruit regrowth (use this if your fruit has different rotations). If set, overrides `after_place_node` of fruit node to be able to differentiate fruits by param2 when placed by player.\n* `multiplier`: multiplier for the standard average regrowth time.\n\n**Examples:**\n```\nregrowing_fruits.add(\"default:apple\", \"default:leaves\")\nregrowing_fruits.add(\"ethereal:golden_apple\", \"ethereal:yellowleaves\", nil, 3)\nregrowing_fruits.add(\"cacaotree:pod\", \"cacaotree:trunk\", -1)\n```\n\nFor more examples see [init.lua](https://git.sp-codes.de/minetest/regrowing_fruits/src/branch/master/init.lua).\n\nAlternative Mods\n----\n\nConsider using [`regrow`](https://content.minetest.net/packages/TenPlus1/regrow/) by TenPlus1. It has similar features, but registers only one placeholder node in total instead of one node for every fruit.\n\nCredits\n----\n\nThis mod is based on \"[endless_apples](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=20060)\" by Shara RedCat (2018).\n",
