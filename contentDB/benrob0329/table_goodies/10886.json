This module is supposed to be dead-simple to grab and start using in your project without adding anything extra. One of Lua's strengths is minimalism, and I think that it's ecosystem would do well to mirror that.\n","maintainers":["benrob0329"],"media_license":"CC0-1.0","name":"table_goodies","provides":["table_goodies"],"release":10886,"repo":"https://gitlab.com/benrob0329/lua-table_goodies","score":2.2,"screenshots":[],"short_description":"A small package for extra (can't live without) functions for working with tables.","state":"APPROVED","tags":["library"],"thumbnail":null,"title":"Table Goodies","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/benrob0329/table_goodies/releases/10886/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"benrob0329/table_goodies":[]},"hash":"0mpfh0dc2d06kjzflyjjmgi6zzq8097ypy1890sn7fmfja5bwn6b"}
