From `#000` to `#FFF`.\n\nUpdate: This mod now uses colour palettes. so there are 16 nodes instead of 4096.\nand each node uses a 256 colour palette.\n\nHere is how it works. For the red channel, the blocks are changed, for the blue and green, the param2 is changed.\n\nLets say you place down the colour `#49f` the node that is placed down is `hexcol:4xx` the last 2 hex digits are converted to decimal and placed in the param2 therefore defining a colour from one of the 16 palette images generated by the PHP script in this repo.\n\nThis mod is currently only for use with creative mode. There is no way to obtain the nodes in survival. Anyone is welcome to make a mod to provide such a method.\n\n## Settings\n\n* `hexcol_inv` (bool Default: true) Show hexcol nodes in creative inventory.\n\n## Features\n\n* LOTS of colours good for decorative builds such as pixel art.\n* Small. Mod code is small.\n\n## Drawbacks\n\n* Floods the creative inventory if hexcol_inv is true (default)\n\n## License\n\nCode is licensed under the MIT license. Image assets are CC0. Though the block texture is just a pain white image so I dont think I could copyright it even if I wanted to lol.\n","maintainers":["erov"],"media_license":"MIT","name":"hexcol","provides":["hexcol"],"release":25712,"repo":"https://gitoverit.ofafox.com/Bob/hexcol.git","score":5.1,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/988433545d.png"],"short_description":"Adds nodes with colour palattes for each 3 character hex value like #fff","state":"APPROVED","tags":["building","creative"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/988433545d.png","title":"Hexadecimal Colours","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/erov/hexcol/releases/25712/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"erov/hexcol":[]},"hash":"1z99kxls7hmhd8x3shg48fmcn5q1wlqp1xsb5gmyqmhq2frg3s3b"}
