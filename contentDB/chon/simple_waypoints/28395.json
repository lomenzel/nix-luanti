Choose the method that you find most convenient.\n\n\nTEXT INTERFACE:\n\n- **Create Waypoint:** `/wc <waypoint name>`\n- **Delete Waypoint:** `/wd <waypoint name>`\n- **Teleport to Waypoint:** `/wt <waypoint name>`\n- **List Waypoints:** `/wl` - Displays a list of your waypoints in a user-friendly table format, including coordinates (e.g., \"1. Home (x,y,z)\").\n\n* \"teleport\" privilege is required to create waypoints.\n\nGUI:\n\n- **Use menu:** `/wf`\n\nNOTE:\nIf beacons are enabled, the GUI allows you to select a color from 8 available options.  When creating waypoints using the chat commands, a random color will be selected instead. To enable beacons, go to the minetest settings and search for the option: \"beacons.enable\".\n\n\nWorks with Minetest 5.2.0+\n\n#### Installation\n\nExtract zip to the mods folder.","maintainers":["chon"],"media_license":"LGPL-3.0-only","name":"simple_waypoints","provides":["simple_waypoints"],"release":28395,"repo":"https://github.com/carloschon/simple_waypoints","score":19.5,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/7d5a6fdbd7.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/a9a16c36b7.png"],"short_description":"A simple way to mark and teleport to important locations in your world","state":"APPROVED","tags":["chat","gui","hud"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/7d5a6fdbd7.png","title":"Simple Waypoints","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/chon/simple_waypoints/releases/28395/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"chon/simple_waypoints":[]},"hash":"14ygl7w5h6q0aacjzzi77d3gpfasigkf1dyq0v2n9ca6sip6nqa2"}
