  "long_description": "This mod adds displays, inspired by those from the `textline` mod, which support the Advtrains LuaATC system. They are in fact operation panels with fancy displays strapped on them.\n\n\n## How to use\n\nPlace a display, then right-click on it, and you will see a screen much like the one you see with LuaATC operation panels. You can use code in it. LuaATC Textlines will receive special `display` and `refresh` events, which frequency can be set in the Luanti settings. Those events are only sent to a textline if it is loaded, to avoid borking up the server.\n\nThe `display()` function takes one argument, which is the text to display.\n\nThe default font, color, etc. can be configured in the Luanti settings.\n\n\n#### Provided displays\n\nThis mod provides a flat green display, and two \"hanging\" displays (a green one and an orange one). They *glow* in the dark.\n\n\n#### LBM\n\nText is rendered on the Textlines through an entity. It is possible that, for some reason, the entity disappears, in which case the display will be rendered useless. For this reason, LuaATC Textline offers to register a LBM to check for entities for every textline, and re-create an entity if a textline lacks one. This LBM can be disabled in the Luanti settings. By default it will only run once per textline; if you frequently delete entities (such as with /clearobjects) you may want to run it every time a textline is loaded. (There is an option for that.)\n\n\n#### Dependencies\n\nThis mod depends on `font_api`, from the `Display modpack`, and on `advtrains_luaautomation`, from `Advtrains`. `font_api` is not strictly needed, but there is currently no fallback.\n\n\n## How to make new LuaATC Textlines\n\nUse `luaatc_textline.register_textline(name, def)` to register a new textline. Then you can somewhat customize the display, e.g with color, glow, custom entity properties (evenchanging the visual, etc), etc.\n\n\n## Media information\n\nCredits to Gabriel Maia and Segvault for creating the mod `textline` in the first place.\n\nPart of the code is inspired by the original `textline` code.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all media were made by Nazalassa and licensed under the CC-BY-SA-4.0 license. The following media are \"otherwise noted\":\n\n* `textures/luaatc_textline_any.png` comes from `textline` and was originally published under the WTFPL.\n* `textures/luaatc_textline_background.png` comes from `textline` and was originally published under the WTFPL.\n",
