This mod is mainly to add runces for crafting items and building items which cannot be exploded by tnt. The rune breaker is for breaking a new type of breakable item. The type name is runic and has 5 levels; the higher the runic level, up to level 5, the easier and faster it is to break. The rune breaker by default has no crafting recipe.\nHere is an unedited video going over my modpack: https://youtu.be/7vslISAOu5w\nRelease 2.1.0 adds a new craft recipe for the charged rune and updates the dependancies of the rune blocks mod\nRelease 2.2.0 adds more types of rune dust\nRelease 2.2.1 adds some missing recipes to rune dust and rebalances uncharged rune dust\nRelease 2.2.2 fixed linux missing textures\nRelease 2.2.3 updated recipes and ore distribution to get easier\nRelease 2.2.4 updated optional dependancies to allow for use in Nonsenical Skyblock Game","maintainers":["liteninglazer"],"media_license":"CC-BY-3.0","name":"mystic_runes","provides":["mystic_dust","mystic_rune_blocks","mystic_runes"],"release":20356,"repo":null,"score":3.6,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/e7e5160168.png"],"short_description":"Adds runes which can be used to craft powerful items.","state":"APPROVED","tags":["magic"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/e7e5160168.png","title":"Mystic Runes","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/liteninglazer/mystic_runes/releases/20356/download/","video_thumbnail_url":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/youtube/7vslISAOu5w.jpg","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vslISAOu5w","website":null,"dependencies":{"liteninglazer/mystic_runes":[]},"hash":"0mjdvjsr4a7j88xdygbqh7zbvhzfqfyp0pz55pc6191b6j2rv1qj"}
