  "long_description": "# playeranim\n\nMakes the head, and the right arm when you're mining, face the way you're facing, similar to Minecraft. Compatible with [3d_armor](https://content.luanti.org/packages/stu/3d_armor/). This is an ugly hack. Forked from [Kaeza's animplus mod](https://github.com/kaeza/minetest-animplus).\n\nThe head only turns up and down relative to the body, except it turns slightly to the right/left when you strafe right/left. When you turn the body turns with the head.  \nWorks in both singleplayer and multiplayer.\n\nCreated by [Rui](https://github.com/Rui-Minetest), this document was written by [sloantothebone](https://github.com/sloantothebone).\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Version of player model\n\nPlayer models supported by this mod:\n\n- minetest_game after 4 Jun 2017, Minetest 0.4.16\n- minetest_game after 4 Nov 2017, Minetest 5.0.0\n\n### The delay of sideways body rotation\n\nConfigure `playeranim.body_rotation_delay`.\nIt's the number of frame delay of sideways body rotation.  \nThe default value is `7`.\n\n### Lengthways body rotation in sneaking\n\nConfigure `playeranim.body_x_rotation_sneak`.\nIt's the degrees of the body's X-axis rotation in sneaking.  \nThe default value is `6.0`.\n\n### The speed of an animation\n\nConfigure `playeranim.animation_speed`.\nIt's the number of stepping per seconds.  \nThe default value is `2.4`.\n\n### The speed of an animation in sneaking\n\nConfigure `playeranim.animation_speed_sneak`.\nIt's the number of stepping per seconds in sneaking.  \nThe default value is `0.8`.\n",
