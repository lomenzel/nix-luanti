  "long_description": "# Jafa-Command-Assistant\nThis is a Minetest mod to assist anyone with commands in game. It adds commands such as /day, /admin and /fly to make your Minetest experience easier.\n## Possible uses\n1. If you are a server admin, you will find this tool useful as it allows you to control some of the most used player permissions, announce to all players without your nametag to stand out in chat and also control who has admin controls on your server.\n\n2. If you are just playing with friends, the commands such as /fly, /tp and /day might be useful for letting people fly, shortening the teleport command and setting the time to day without extensive knowledge of commands.\n\n3. If you are playing singleplayer then the /fly or /admin command will be useful to allow you to have full control of your world.\n\n4. If you are a teacher at a school using Minetest with pupils to easily control permissions and what they can do.\n## Commands\n1. /admin <Target> | <Me> - This command allows you to grant players every privilege in the base game including the 'announce' privilege from this mod.\n\n2. /day - This command will instantly set the in game time to 12000 or midday.\n\n3. /fly <Target> | <Me> - This command will grant the 'fly' privilege to any player allowing them to fly.\n\n4. /info <Target> - This will post the ip address of the target to the command callers chat only.\n\n5. /mute <Target> | <Me> - This will mute players in chat, stopping them from posting chat or using the '/shout' command that comes with this mod.\n\n6. /noadmin <Target> | <Me> - This will remove all privileges from the target excluding 'interact' and 'shout' as these are the default privileges.\n\n7. /nofly <Target> | <Me> - This will remove the 'fly' privilege from the target removing their ability to fly.\n\n8. /shout <Message> - This will post the specified message in chat in the format '[ANNOUNCEMENT] <message>'.\n\n9. /stop <Reason> - This will shutdown the server and give the reason specified in this format 'Access denied.
