  "long_description": "This mod limits you to the spawn chunk, to increase difficulty. It also builds a nice obsidian marker around your 16-by-16 area of freedom (that you cannot mine).\n\nIt works by constraining your position within the chunk, and disallowing any mining and building outside the chunk.",
