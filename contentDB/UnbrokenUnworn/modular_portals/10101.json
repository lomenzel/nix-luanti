  "long_description": "A voxel game where you place portals between rooms.\n\nBuild portals by placing blocks in the slots on the portal frame. A portal will connect to another portal with the same sides, top, and bottom. Valid portals have 4 matching nodes on the bottom slots, 8 matching nodes on each side, and 4 matching nodes on the top slots.\n\nI didn't have time to make infinite content, so I made 9 \"story\" rooms. See if you can connect all 9:\n\n*    Spawn\n*    Room 1 (the one after spawn)\n*    Room 2 (it comes after room 1)\n*    Tree\n*    Forest\n*    Bridge\n*    Storage room (shelves)\n*    Library\n*    Mine",
