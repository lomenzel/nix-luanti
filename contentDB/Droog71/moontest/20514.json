  "long_description": "Moontest: _Moon Habitat Simulator_\n==================================\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\nYou are a prospector on a newly discovered moon.</br>\nYour habitat has been constructed and your mining systems are operational.</br>\n</br>\nAs a resident engineer, you must manage life support systems and</br>\nmining equipment to ensure your income is adequate for survival.</br>\n</br>\nExpenses are deducted from your balance at regular intervals.</br>\nThe amount deducted increases as time goes on, increasing the</br>\ndifficulty of the game the longer you play.</br>\n</br>\nMoontest is playable in both single player and multiplayer game modes.</br>\n</br>\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/LazQEzAa1qM\">Click here to watch a gameplay video.</a>\n</br>\n<h2>Gameplay</h2>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/C8vUbjb.png\"></br>\nThis is your **nuclear reactor**, the power source for your habitat.</br>\nLeft click the reactor to turn it on or off. If the reactor is overloaded</br>\nor you turn it off, all of your equipment will have to be manually restarted.</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Nhk7dFc.png\"></br>\nThis is your **gravity generator**. Without it, other machines become unstable.</br>\nLeft click the generator to turn it on or off. Right click to adjust the intensity.</br>\nThe gravity gravity generator's power consumption is dependent on the intensity.</br>\nLower values allow you to divert power elsewhere. Higher values provide more stability.</br>\nAny value over 100 will also cause your machines to become unstable.</br></br>\n</br>\nThe formula used to calculate gravity's effect on machine stability is below.</br></br>\n</br>\n**if gravity_on() and generated_gravity > 100 then** *--intensity is too high*</br>\n   **stability = 92 - (generated_gravity - 100)** *--stability is reduced*</br>\n**else**</br>\n   **stability = 8 + (gravity_on() * (generated_gravity - 16))** *--stability is increased*</br>\n**end**</br>\n**if stability > 92 then stability = 92 end** *--stability limit*</br>\n**if math.random(0, 100) > stability then something_fails() end** *--failures occur*</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/DKEuwe0.png\"></br>\nThis is your **oxygen generator**. Without it, you cannot survive. Left click the</br>\ngenerator to turn it on or off. Right click the generator to adjust it's output.</br>\nThe oxygen generator's power consumption is dependent on it's output.</br>\nLower values allow you to divert power elsewhere. Higher values provide more safety.</br>\nExtremely high oxygen output settings can be dangerous.</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/w9zg6Wa.png\"></br>\nThis is your **hvac system**. Without it, you cannot survive. Left click the</br>\nbox on top to turn it on or off. Right click the box to adjust the thermostat.</br>\nThe hvac system's power consumption is dependent on the thermostat setting.</br>\nLower values allow you to divert power elsewhere. Higher values provide more safety.</br>\nExtremely high thermostat settings can be dangerous.</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/86vFPBM.png\"></br>\nThis is your **mining drill**; your primary source of passive income.</br>\nLeft click the drill to turn it on or off. Right click to adjust it's speed.</br>\nThe drill's power consumption is dependent on the speed setting. Be careful</br>\nabout increasing this without adjusting the speed of your coolant pump.</br>\nIf not, you will experience greater fluctuations in power consumption and</br>\nmay overload your reactor.</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yjbRGCg.png\"></br>\nThis is your **coolant system**. This prevents the mining drill from overloading the reactor.</br>\nLeft click the coolant pump to turn it on or off. Right click the pump to adjust it's speed.</br>\nThe coolant system's power consumption is dependent on the pump speed.</br>\nThe speed setting should be set with reference to the drill's speed setting.</br>\n</br>\nThe formula used to calculate the pump's effect on the drill is below.</br>\n</br>\n**resistance = math.random(drill_speed * 2, drill_speed * 3)** *--the resistance*</br>\n**digging = drill_speed + resistance** *--the amount of ore mined*</br>\n**cooling = pump_is_on * pump_speed * 3** *--cooling provided*</br>\n**if cooling > resistance * 0.9 then cooling = resistance * 0.9 end** *--cooling limit*</br>\n**drill_power = digging - cooling** *--the power consumption of the drill*</br>\n**money = money + digging** *--the amount of money earned from the ore*</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/CyTmGYz.png\"></br>\nThis is your **space food vending machine**. Without it, you cannot survive.</br>\nRestocking fees are a part of your regular expenses. Left click to buy food.</br>\nLeft click with the food in your hand to eat it. Space food replenishes your</br>\nhunger if you are hungry and heals you if you are full.</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lyr1Sxg.png\"></br>\nThese are your **sleeping quarters**. Without sleep, you will eventually die.</br>\nKeep an eye on your energy level and when you need to sleep, left click the</br>\nmiddle of the bottom bunk on one of the bunk beds. You will sleep until your</br>\nenergy is full then you will be moved to the lobby of the space habitat.</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/mo5QWX0.png\"></br>\nThis is your **research station**. Here, you can conduct research on organic matter</br>\n'harvested' on the moon's surface. Organic matter is worth $10 each early in the game.</br>\nThis value increase each time you process research data. The limit is $50.</br>\nTo conduct research, left click the research station while holding the organic matter.",
