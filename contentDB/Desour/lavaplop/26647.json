PRs welcome!\n\nMods can also use the API (see below) to make their own nodes plop.\n\n\n## API\n\nTo register your node as a plopper (ploppers are nodes that plop), add the\nfollowing to your node definition:\n\n```\ngroups = {..., lavaplop_plopper = 1}, -- (unused yet, but good to have anyways)\n_lavaplop = {\n\tplopper = {\n\t\t-- the plop sound.\n\t\t-- if `nil`, the provided sound will be used\n\t\tsound = SimpleSoundSpec,\n\t},\n}\n```\n\n\n## Settings\n\nThere are several settings, please consult the mainmenu.\n\nIf you're a layman, please note that if you crank up the settings too much, and\nthe game seems to still be responsive, the server thread might already be\noverloaded, ruining your playing experience in other ways. Check your `max_lag`\nvalue in `/status`.\nIf you're not a layman, uncomment the line `print_perf()` line.\n\n\n## Implementation details\n\nThe mod does not use abms or node timers.\nInstead, it randomly picks nodes around the players on each globalstep, and\nchecks if the node is relevant.\nThe main reason why I made this mod is because I wanted to try out how good this\nworks.\n\nThe result are, roughly, on average, with default settings if not mentioned\notherwise, for a single player in singleplayer (60Hz (17 ms) server steps):\n\n```\n`check_radius` | number of checks (s^-1) | time used per step (ms)\n---------------|-------------------------|------------------------\n10             | 64                      | 0.05\n20 (default)   | 780                     | 0.09\n30             | 2900                    | 0.15\n```\n\n\n## Sounds sources\n\nThe sounds were generated using [sfxr](https://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html).\nThe parameters for the sounds can be found in `sounds_src/`.\nThey were exported on a machine where `sizeof(int)=4`, `sizeof(float)=4`,\nand `sizeof(bool)=1`.\n\n\n## Licensing\n\nThe project uses [REUSE](https://reuse.software/).","maintainers":["Desour"],"media_license":"CC-BY-SA-4.0","name":"lavaplop","provides":["lavaplop"],"release":26647,"repo":"https://codeberg.org/Desour/lavaplop","score":4.1,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/7372835efc.jpg"],"short_description":"Makes lava plop every now and then","state":"APPROVED","tags":["environment"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/7372835efc.png","title":"Lavaplop","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/Desour/lavaplop/releases/26647/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"Desour/lavaplop":[]},"hash":"10d1bz6sh7bqli8v896rxb94jp6cqdj4914jihmydnxfklndk6fv"}
