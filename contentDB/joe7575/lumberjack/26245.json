  "long_description": "This mod allows to completely fell trees by destroying only one block. The whole tree is harvested and moved to the player's inventory or alternatively, the tree trunk items are dropped. See 'settingtypes.txt' for configuration options.\n\nBut therefore, some lumberjack skills are needed. New player normally will not get the necessary skills immediately, they have to harvest the tree from the top, block by block \"to improve their skills\".\n\nThis mod fulfills several aspects:\n\n - To prevent limitless griefing on servers, new players have to \"improve their skills\" by removing tree trunks from the top downwards. \n - New players are trained to always fell trees completely and replace them with saplings (education for sustainability)\n - Trained players with additional \"skills\" get lumberjack privs to fell trees more efficiently \n - No parts of trees hanging in the air anymore\n\nIf you are playing in singleplayer, type `/set_lumberjack_points singleplayer 0` to skip the training phase.\nYou need `server` privs to be able to use this command (type `/grantme server`). \n\nOr you go into the \"All Settings\" Menu > Mods > lumberjack and set \"lumberjack_points\" to 0 (zero)",
