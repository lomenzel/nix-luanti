Place your rails and build a route with two endpoints. Junctions are allowed \n   as long as each route has its own start and endpoint.\n2. Place a Railway Buffer at both endpoints. (buffers are always needed, \n   they store the route and timing information)\n3. Give both Railway Buffers unique station names, like Oxford and Cambridge\n4. Place a Minecart at a buffer and give it a cart number (1..999)\n5. Drive from buffer to buffer in both directions using the Minecart(!) to record the \n   routes (use 'right-left' keys to control the Minecart)\n6. Punch the buffers to check the connection data (e.g. \"Oxford: connected to Cambridge\")\n7. Optional: Configure the Minecart waiting time in both buffers. The Minecart\n   will then start automatically after the configured time\n8. Optional: Protect your rail network with the Protection Landmarks (one Landmark \n   at least every 16 nodes/meters)\n9. Place a Minecart in front of the buffer and check whether it starts after the \n   configured time\n10. Check the cart state via the chat command: `/mycart <num>`.\n    '<num>' is the cart number, or get a list of carts with `/mycart`\n11. Drop items into the Minecart and punch the cart to start it, or \"sneak+click\" the \n    Minecart to get cart and items back\n\n\nManual\n------\n\nSee [Wiki](https://github.com/joe7575/minecart/wiki)\n","maintainers":["joe7575"],"media_license":"CC0-1.0","name":"minecart","provides":["minecart"],"release":29187,"repo":"https://github.com/joe7575/minecart","score":353.9,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/4549108e63.png"],"short_description":"Minecart, the lean railway transportation automation system","state":"APPROVED","tags":["transport"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/4549108e63.png","title":"Minecart","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/joe7575/minecart/releases/29187/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":"https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/390201539","website":null,"dependencies":{"joe7575/minecart":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"carts","packages":["1248/castrum","1248/regnum","mt-mods/blockcolor","Minetest/minetest_game","1248/regnum2","miroptics/qiskitblocks_miro","Casimir/voxelgarden","Kimapr/nonsensical_skyblock","JavaFXpert/qiskitblocks","bell07/whynot_game","Big_Caballito/no_mans_land","MeseCraft/mesecraft","TheFanne/raining_nodes","PetiAPocok/minetest_extended","hilol/epic_combat","EmptyStar/asuna","mt-mods/dreambuilder_game"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"default","packages":["AiTechEye/xaenvironment","Hi_World/newplanet","Noodlemire/voxeldungeon","JALdMIC/survivethedays","sunnysideup/holidayhorrors","BuckarooBanzay/mesecons_lab","nam/porko","Amaz/lordofthetest","1248/castrum","Thunder1035/etb","1248/regnum","Minetest/minetest_game","debiankaios/proxima_survival","carlos_rupp/berzerkpt","1248/regnum2","miroptics/qiskitblocks_miro","KareaGhandTrail/block_assault_mapmaker","KareaGhandTrail/block_assault","Casimir/voxelgarden","bell07/whynot_game","JavaFXpert/qiskitblocks","Kimapr/nonsensical_skyblock","jgordon510/gridlocks","giga-turbo/codecube","niwla23/runorfall","Thunder1035/pacman","Big_Caballito/no_mans_land","MeseCraft/mesecraft","hilol/epic_combat","TheFanne/raining_nodes","rlars/occupymoon_game","PetiAPocok/minetest_extended","mooD_Slayer/ksurvive","EmptyStar/asuna","mt-mods/dreambuilder_game","rubenwardy/capturetheflag"]}]},"hash":"16a6n3swfhiinky3zyxyz6278y8x9aa08zp337bhkm1ibcz1xbav"}
