Exceeding the limit will cause them to turn into a ghost or ban them.\nYou can define how many times a player will be able to respawn after dying and whether they will be completely excluded from the game (banned) or just turn into a ghost (has no interact priv).\n# Commands\nUse `/deaths [<player>]` to check how often you or another player (requires `lim_lives` priv) has died.  \nUse `/reset_deaths [<player>]` to reset your own or another palyer's (requires `lim_lives` priv) deaths.",
