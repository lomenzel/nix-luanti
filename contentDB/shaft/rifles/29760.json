It only contains modern arms. Other weapons are in the Shuriken and the Power Guns mod.\n\nInstead of a skill system it features an accuracy system where sneaking or standing still makes your aim more steady.\n\nTNT explodes instantly when shot at. There is ricochet, node penetration and mob penetration. Ricochet is hardcoded to 2 reflections. You can kill yourself with ricochet bullets, so be careful. Penetration means a bullet passes through while causing damage. It's indicated by a little smoke particle.\n\nThe Minigun has been restored. It isn't available in the mod Rangedweapons because of a bug.\n\nGlass panes and full glass nodes can be broken by shooting them. They will turn into broken versions which damage the player, can be walked through and drop glass fragments in MTG. Replace them by hand or use /glassrepair to repair glass in a 50 nodes radius.\n\nSome guns use ammunition, they don't use in reality: M1991 and Thompson use 9mm instead of the removed .45 ACP because they are very similar, Colt Python uses 9mm instead of .357, Taurus and Desert Eagle use 9mm instead of .44.\n\nThe intermediate items in rangedweapons do not exist in this mod. I decided on making a workbench for crafting directly from source materials instead because the intermediate items were not easily discoverable and looking up the recipes defeats the puzzle game purpose of the crafting grid.\n\nGrenades can be thrown and picked up again. That means you can throw them back too. Make sure you make the grenade live with rightclick before throwing, otherwise nothing will happen. Be careful that they don't explode in your inventory.\n\nIn creative mode rifles last forever.\n\n\nKnown issues:\n\n* https://github.com/minetest/minetest/issues/15528\n\nSometimes the automatic guns keeps fireing until you move the mouse. This is a problem with the engine and not the mod and will hopefully be fixed in the next release.\n\n* https://github.com/minetest/minetest/issues/15574\n\nBullet holes don't face the right direction yet.","maintainers":["shaft"],"media_license":"CC-BY-SA-4.0","name":"rifles","provides":["rifles"],"release":29760,"repo":"https://gitgud.io/blut/rifles","score":67.6,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/6b73cf785c.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/475bae872e.jpg","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/74214e3676.jpg"],"short_description":"Adds guns, rocket launchers and grenades.","state":"APPROVED","tags":["pvp","shooter","survival","tools"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/6b73cf785c.png","title":"Rifles","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/shaft/rifles/releases/29760/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"shaft/accuracy":[],"shaft/rifles":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"accuracy","packages":["shaft/accuracy"]}]},"hash":"02x1lj7jz5393q2lsiv7n2p8dlmdi81y4zfx5v419bhxaa2ca6vr"}
