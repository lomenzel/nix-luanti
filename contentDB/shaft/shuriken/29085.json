  "long_description": "The textures and sound are from *rangedweapons* but the code is fully rewritten. It uses raytracing for collision detections.\n\nStop moving or sneak to gain more accuracy. Accuracy is indicated by the size of the circle. You'll also get a hit indicator if you hit a mob or player.\n\nYou can craft and throw shuriken and they will fly, spin, hit the mob or player and damage him or get stuck in a node. You can pick it up with left click.\n\nUnlike *rangedweapons* I've intentionally not made them pass through leaves because that would make them hard to pick up.\n\n# Please let me know\n* if you'd like damage adjustments\n* if you'd like crafting amount adjustments\n* if you want to contribute a translation (if you don't know git you can just paste it here but please format as code block < / >)",
