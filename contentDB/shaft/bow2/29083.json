  "long_description": "# Bow2\n\nFork of NextGen Bows which was forked from X Bows by SaKeL, edits made by StarNinjas and shaft. I forked it because StarNinjas is inactive for months at the time of writing and thus can't merge my improvements.\n\nAdds a bow and arrows. This is a drop-in replacement for Nextgen Bows. You can uninstall Nextgen Bows and install this with no errors.\n\n##Improvements over Nextgen Bows\n\n* easier pickup, just left click\n* fixed mob mod hit detection, they now take damage from arrows\n* better recipe, arrows can now be crafted using items from mobs mod too (animalia:feather was changed to group:feather)\n* removed redundant rotated textures\n* now only applies knockback to players and known mobs to prevent weird bugs\n\n## Features\n* takes arrows from anywhere in your inventory\n* bow will force you sneak when loaded (optional dep. playerphysics)\n* loaded bow will slightly adjust the player FOV\n* bow uses minetest tool capabilities - if the bow is not loaded for long enough (time from last puch) the arrow will fly shorter range\n* arrow uses raycast\n* arrow has chance of critical shots/hits (only on full punch interval)\n* arrow uses minetest damage calculation (including 3d_armor) for making damage (no hardcoded values)\n* arrows stick to nodes\n* arrows remove them self from the world after some time\n* arrows remove them self if there are already too many arrows attached to node, player, entity\n* arrow continues to fly downwards when attached node is dug\n* arrow flies under water for short period of time and then sinks\n* arrows adjusts pitch when flying\n* arrows can be picked up again after stuck in solid nodes\n* registers only one entity reused for all arrows\n\n## Optional Dependencies\n\n- default (recipes)\n- farming (bow and recipes)\n- 3d_armor (calculates damage including the armor)\n- playerphysics (force sneak when holding charged bow)\n- player_monoids (force sneak when holding charged bow)\n",
