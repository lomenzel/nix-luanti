  "long_description": "# Visible Wielditem\n\nShows wielded items in-world.\n\n## Features\n\nModern alternative to [`wield3d`](https://github.com/stujones11/wield3d):\n\n* Relies less on deprecated engine APIs, doesn't aim to support older MT versions\n* Supports colored items. Works well with [`epidermis`](https://github.com/appgurueu/epidermis).\n* Supports glow (for environmental lighting use a wielded light mod)\n* Indicates size of stacks\n* Provides a proper API for mods to use\n* Rotates the model instead of the texture\n\n## License\n\nCode written by [appgurueu](https://github.com/appgurueu) and licensed under the MIT license.\n\nThe screenshot (`screenshot.png`) uses [Hugues Ross'](https://content.minetest.net/users/Hugues%20Ross/) [RPG16](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Hugues%20Ross/rpg16/) texture pack, which is licensed under CC-BY-SA-4.0, and is therefore licensed under CC-BY-SA-4.0 as well.\n\n\n## API\n\nAll within the `visible_wielditem` global variable.\n\n### `get_attachment(modelname, itemname)`\n\nReturns a table with fields `bonename`, `position` (unit: metric/nodes), `rotation` (unit: degrees) and `scale` (number, unit: metric/nodes) based on model attachments and item tweaks.\n\n### `model_attachments`\n\nTable. Keys are model media (file) names, values are tables with field `bonename`, `position`, `rotation` and `scale`. The special field `default` is used for default attachment settings based on `character.b3d` if no model attachments are specified for a player model or if the specified attachment settings are incomplete.\n\n### `item_tweaks`\n\nTable of tweaks applied based on the item. Subtable entries have strings as keys and tweak tables with fields `position`, `rotation` and `scale` as values. `position`s are added up, `rotation`s are properly composed, `scale` is multiplied.\n\n#### `types`\n\nApplies tweaks based on item type. Possible keys are `unknown`, `node`, `tool` and `craftitem`.\n\n#### `groups`\n\nTweaks for a key are applied if the item has an item group with that name.\n\n#### `names`\n\nTweaks for a single item, by full item name.\n",
