Code by Lars Mueller aka LMD or appguru(eu) and licensed under the MIT license.\n\nPart of the Limit Series: [`item_limit`](https://github.com/appgurueu/item_limit), [`place_limit`](https://github.com/appgurueu/place_limit) and [`cycle_limit`](https://github.com/appgurueu/cycle_limit)\n\n## Features\n\n* When switching between inventory slots, the item you are switching to will be \"hidden\"\n* A bar appears showing you the time left, and after it's over (or if you switch again) the hidden items reappear\n* During switching you can only use your hand\n* Hidden items are not lost if the server crashes\n* `cycle_limit` priv allows evasion\n* Alternative mode works by granting/removing `interact`\n  * To prevent players from having interact, revoke both `interact` and `interact_mods`\n\nKnown issues:\n\n* The item is temporarily removed from the inventory\n  * Can't be circumvented because else `get_wield_item` would return item that is being switched to\n  * Accordingly, it can't be seen\n\n## Screenshot\n\n![Screenshot](screenshot.png)\n\n### Links\n\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/appgurueu/cycle_limit)\n* [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/ysP74by)\n* [ContentDB](https://content.minetest.net/packages/LMD/cycle_limit)\n* [Minetest Forum](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=24614)\n\n## Configuration\n\nConfiguration can be found under `<worldpath>/conf/cycle_limit.json`.\n\nDefault configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"name\": \"Switching\",\n    \"duration\": 2,\n    \"color\": \"545AA7\",\n    \"interact\": true\n}\n```\n\n* `name` is the timer name\n* `duration` is the time it takes to switch in seconds\n* `color` is a hex color (but without `#`)\n* `interact` is a boolean indicating whether the `interact` privilege should be revoked","maintainers":["LMD"],"media_license":"MIT","name":"cycle_limit","provides":["cycle_limit"],"release":15337,"repo":"https://github.com/appgurueu/cycle_limit","score":303.6,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/WpgAaYQ6P9.png"],"short_description":"Limits hotbar slot switching","state":"APPROVED","tags":["inventory","survival"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/WpgAaYQ6P9.png","title":"Cycle Limit","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/LMD/cycle_limit/releases/15337/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"LMD/cycle_limit":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"modlib","packages":["LMD/modlib","zanderdev/skyblock_zero","sdd/spiraling_down","LMD/cellestial_game","Kimapr/nonsensical_skyblock"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"hud_timers","packages":["LMD/cellestial_game","LMD/hud_timers"]}],"LMD/hud_timers":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"modlib","packages":["LMD/modlib","zanderdev/skyblock_zero","sdd/spiraling_down","LMD/cellestial_game","Kimapr/nonsensical_skyblock"]}],"LMD/modlib":[]},"hash":"1mcvgygdb9z2km8f938v5g4by4zww8nsdj0n3908f7s91wy8wxv3"}
