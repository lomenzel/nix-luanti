Licensed under the MIT License. Written by Lars Mueller aka LMD or appguru(eu).\n\n## Screenshot\n\n![Screenshot](screenshot.png)\n\n## Links\n\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/appgurueu/respawn_timer) - sources, issue tracking, contributing\n* [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/ysP74by) - discussion, chatting\n* [Minetest Forum](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=25749) - (more organized) discussion\n* [ContentDB](https://content.minetest.net/packages/LMD/respawn_timer) - releases (cloning from GitHub is recommended)\n\n## Features\n\n* Player is actually dead while dead (`player:get_hp() == 0`). This minimizes breakage of other mods.\n* Custom respawn formspec (simple button).\n* Enhanced security: Actions of dead players (chatting, inventory, ...) are forbidden.\n* Basic persistence: Rejoining will only reset the timer.\n\n## API\n\nRelies on multiple hacks and thus imposes the following limitations on other mods:\n\n* No manual modification of the `minetest.registered_on_dieplayers` table `on_mods_loaded`\n* No insertion at index 1 of the `minetest.registered_on_chat_messages` table `on_mods_loaded`\n  * Mods doing this have to be listed as optional dependencies\n* Mods using bone position overrides on nonstandard bones have to use the API for those to be preserved properly\n  * Standard bone names are `\"Head\"`, `\"Body\"`, `\"Arm_Right\"`, `\"Arm_Left\"`, `\"Leg_Right\"`, `\"Leg_Left\"`\n  * `respawn_timer.bone_names_by_model[\"<filename>.<ext>\"] = { \"Bone_1\", \"Bone_2\", ... }` including standard bone names if used\n  * If both bone position and rotation are set to `{ x = 0, y = 0, z = 0 }`, the bone will be ignored\n\nRespawning can be done using `respawn_timer.respawn(player_ref)`, the timer can be modified by altering the exposed table\n\n```lua\nrespawn_timer.timer = {\n    name = \"Respawn\",\n    duration = 5,\n    color = \"FF00FF\"\n}\n```\n","maintainers":["LMD"],"media_license":"MIT","name":"respawn_timer","provides":["respawn_timer"],"release":15332,"repo":"https://github.com/appgurueu/respawn_timer","score":5.7,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/UxfWOGKNzK.png"],"short_description":"Forces players to wait a set duration before respawning","state":"APPROVED","tags":["adventure__rpg","pve","pvp"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/UxfWOGKNzK.png","title":"Respawn Timer","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/LMD/respawn_timer/releases/15332/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"LMD/hud_timers":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"modlib","packages":["LMD/modlib","zanderdev/skyblock_zero","sdd/spiraling_down","LMD/cellestial_game","Kimapr/nonsensical_skyblock"]}],"LMD/modlib":[],"LMD/respawn_timer":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"modlib","packages":["LMD/modlib","zanderdev/skyblock_zero","sdd/spiraling_down","LMD/cellestial_game","Kimapr/nonsensical_skyblock"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"hud_timers","packages":["LMD/cellestial_game","LMD/hud_timers"]}]},"hash":"010yib0j94d7dkq6dx2dlnvf27knqagn92gqzha9xca3mv3lqfn0"}
