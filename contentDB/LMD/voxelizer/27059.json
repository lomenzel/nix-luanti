Sort of the opposite of [`wesh`](https://github.com/entuland/wesh) and [`meshport`](https://github.com/random-geek/meshport).\nAnother mighty world manipulation tool like [`worldedit`](https://github.com/Uberi/Minetest-WorldEdit). Blazing fast.\n\n## About\n\n**Note: Voxelizer needs to be added to the \"trusted mods\" if \"mod security\" is enabled. You should always ensure that all your \"trusted mods\" run in a safe environment (which means that all other mods are safe as well).**\n\nDepends on [`modlib`](https://github.com/appgurueu/modlib) and [`cmdlib`](https://github.com/appgurueu/cmdlib).

If in need for help, just do `/help vox`.\nYou need the `voxelizer` priv to use any of the Voxelizer commands. Some commands require extra privs.\nMedia - models, textures and nodemaps (color lookups) - is stored in `<worldpath>/media`.\nIf you are unsure about which settings to use, either do some research or *try it and see*.\nEditing the placed models is recommended; Voxelizer might place a few blocks undesirably, which needs to be fixed by hand.\nVoxelizer needs to be added as to the trusted mods in the settings in order to be able to read textures or download files.\nDisabling mod security would also work but is **not** recommended.\n\n### Configuration\n\nPer-player configuration commands. Configuration remains after shutdown (is persistent).\n\n* `texture [path]` - set/get the current texture (see [Supported File Formats](#supported-file-formats))\n* `nodemap [path]` - set/get the current nodemap (see [Supported File Formats](#supported-file-formats))\n* `dithering [id]` - set/get the current error diffusion dithering algorithms (specify algorithm ID)\n* `color_choosing [id]` - set/get current color choosing mode (best/average)\n* `filtering [id]` - set/get current filtering mode (nearest/bilinear)\n* `placement [id]` - set/get merge modes (specify mode ID)\n* `model [path]` - set/get the current 3D model (see [Supported File Formats](#supported-file-formats))\n* `alpha_weighing [enable/disable]` - get/enable/disable weighing colors (see `color_choosing`) by their alpha\n* `protection_bypass [enable/disable]` - get/enable/disable protection bypass (you need the priv `protection_bypass` to enable it)\n* `precision [number]` - set/get the current rasterization accuracy (integer). Note that this increases computation time quadratically. Values higher than `10` are not recommended.\n\n#### Supported file formats\n\n##### Textures\n\nAll file formats supported by `ImageIO` on your Java setup. You can find them out using the following commands : \n```bash\ncd ~/.minetest/mods/voxelizer/production/voxelizer\njava SupportedTextureFormats\n```\nOn my system (Java 11), the output was : \n```\nThe supported image file formats are : JPG, jpg, tiff, bmp, BMP, gif, GIF, WBMP, png, PNG, JPEG, tif, TIF, TIFF, wbmp, jpeg\n```\n\nInternally, the `SIF` (`.sif`, \"Simple Image File\") file format (just gave it some name) is used: \n\n* 4 byte header : 2 times a 2 byte unsigned short, first is width, second is height\n* Followed by uncompressed image data : array of 4 byte tuples, consisting of ARGB unsigned bytes, positions in array are calculated as `x + y * width`\n\n##### Node Map\n\nAny valid `minetestmapper-colors.txt` will be accepted by this mod. The format is : \n\nMultiple lines like `[(<content_id:hex>|<nodename>) <red> <green> <blue>][#<comment>]`\n\n##### 3D Models\n\nOnly the `.obj` file format is (with certain restrictions) supported. It is recommended to export your models from Blender.\n\nRestrictions : \n\n* No free form geometry (`vp`s)\n* No complex texture coordinates (`vt`s with more than 2 coordinates given), use simple ones\n* No polygonal faces (`f`s with more than 3 indexes), use triangles\n* No line (`l`) elements\n* No material (`.mtl`) file usage, only a single texture\n* No smooth shading (`s`)\n* No normals (`vn`)\n\nAll of the above will be ignored whenever possible.\n\nExport your .obj files with Blender properly by ticking the right options, as seen here : \n\n![Ticked checkboxes in Blender's \"Export OBJ\" dialog](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/assets/images/tuto-7-model-loading/Blender.png)\n\nSo summarized, the following boxes should be ticked : \n\n- [x] Apply modifiers\n- [x] Write normals (not required)\n- [x] Write UVs\n- [x] Triangulate faces\n- [x] Objects as OBJ objects\n\nEverything else should not be ticked.\n\n### Actions\n\n* `1`/`2` - set first and second edge position, model will be placed thereafter and positions will be deleted\n* `place [scale]` - place model with given scale (defaults to `1`)\n* `download <url> [filename]` - download a file from the internet using a GET request, requires `voxelizer:download` priv additionally.\n  File will be downloaded to `<worldpath>/media/filename`. The URL filename will be taken if `filename` is not specified.\n\n## Configuration\n\nJSON Configuration: `<worldpath>/config/voxelizer.json`\nText Logs: `<worldpath>/logs/voxelizer/<date>.txt`\nReadme : `<modpath/gamepath>/voxelizer/Readme.md`\nDefault Configuration : `<modpath/gamepath>/voxelizer/default_config.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"max_precision\" : 15,\n  \"download\" : true,\n  \"defaults\" : {\n    \"precision\" : 4,\n    \"min_density\" : 0.1,\n    \"dithering\" : 10,\n    \"placement\" : 1,\n    \"color_choosing\" : 1,\n    \"filtering\" : 1\n   }\n}\n```\n\n#### `max_precision`\n\nInteger, maximum settable precision.\n\n#### `download`\n\nBoolean, whether to enable the `/vox download` chatcommand.\n\n#### `defaults`\n\nDictionary / table, default names assigned to corresponding values. Possible names below.\n\n##### `min_density`\n\nFloat between 0 and 1. Minimum density default.\n\n##### `precision`\n\nInteger > 1 and < 100. Precision default.\n\n##### `dithering`\n\nDefault dithering algorithm ID (see `/vox dithering`).\n\n##### `placement`\n\nDefault placement mode ID (see `/vox placement`).\n\n##### `color_choosing`\n\nDefault color choosing algorithm ID (see `/vox color_choosing`).\n\n##### `filtering`\n\nDefault filtering algorithm ID (see `/vox filtering`).\n\n##### `model` / `texture` / `nodemap`\n\nOptional default filenames. Files will be searched in world's media folder.\nIf not given, Voxelizer falls back to default files from mod's media folder.\n\n<!-- best mod -->\n<!-- big pp -->","maintainers":["LMD"],"media_license":"CC-BY-SA-3.0","name":"voxelizer","provides":["voxelizer"],"release":27059,"repo":"https://github.com/appgurueu/voxelizer","score":7.8,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/6wfTDG9kpf.png"],"short_description":"Turns 3D models into astonishing voxel builds.","state":"APPROVED","tags":["creative","world_tools"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/6wfTDG9kpf.png","title":"Voxelizer","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/LMD/voxelizer/releases/27059/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"LMD/cmdlib":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"modlib","packages":["LMD/modlib","zanderdev/skyblock_zero","sdd/spiraling_down","LMD/cellestial_game","Kimapr/nonsensical_skyblock"]}],"LMD/modlib":[],"LMD/voxelizer":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"modlib","packages":["LMD/modlib","zanderdev/skyblock_zero","sdd/spiraling_down","LMD/cellestial_game","Kimapr/nonsensical_skyblock"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"cmdlib","packages":["LMD/cellestial_game","LMD/cmdlib"]}]},"hash":"03zb30bkwkfcfrv8ixqci2k5ihml0q8qd021b8jid1hc62r8nd8d"}
