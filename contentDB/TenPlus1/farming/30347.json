  "long_description": "Farming Redo uses a new realistic way of growing crops so that players can wander the map and have their farms grow in the background, or if you want some fast food you can use the Bonemeal mod to help speed things up.\n\nNew foods need only be planted directly onto tilled soil as no seeds are required. Previous seed-based crops like Wheat, Cotton, Barley, Oats and Rice still have seeds that can be found inside certain grass types.\n\nYou can also use this mod with MineClone.\n",
