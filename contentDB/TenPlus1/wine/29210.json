  "long_description": "This mod lets you ferment different food items into tasty beverages depending on your mods enabled.  Farming Redo gives you grapes into wine and more, Mobs Animals gives you honey into mead, and we have MineClone2 support for wheat into beer etc.\n\nGlasses of drinks can be crafted into a bottle by placing 9x into the crafting grid.  Glasses and Bottles can both be placed for decoration also.  Craft a barrel by adding a top and bottom row of wood and 2 steel ingots either side of middle row.\n\nHover over barrel to give progress information or while inside barrel hover over tiny barrel icon to see what's brewing :)\n\nMany other food items can be used to ferment different alcoholic beverages, and when used with my Stamina mod the player will have drunk effects if you have too much :)\n\nDrink Recipes: https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?p=428319#p428319",
