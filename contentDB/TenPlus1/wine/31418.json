  "long_description": "Craft a barrel that lets you ferment different food items into tasty beverages depending on which mods are enabled.\n\nFarming Redo gives you grapes into wine and more, Mobs Animals gives you honey into mead, and we have MineClone2 support for wheat into beer etc.\n\n9x drink glasses can be crafted into bottles and back again for decoration. Craft a barrel by adding a top and bottom row of wood and 2 steel ingots either side of middle row.\n\nHover over barrel to give progress information or while inside barrel hover over tiny barrel icon to see what's brewing :)\n\nMany other food items can be used to ferment different alcoholic beverages, and the easy to use API lets you add your own to your mods. Also if you use my Stamina mod and drink 4x alcohol you have drunk effects :)\n\nDrink Recipes: https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?p=428319#p428319",
