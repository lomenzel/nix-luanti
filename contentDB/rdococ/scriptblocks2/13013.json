  "long_description": "Scriptblocks 2\n==============\n\nScriptblocks 2 is a Minetest mod and toy programming language using nodes called scriptblocks. Scriptblocks are nodes which can be used to build reusable programs.\n\n## Features\n\n* Support for nested expressions and variables.\n* Custom, named procedures with up to 2 named parameters and dynamic scoping.\n* First-class lists, dictionaries, and lexically scoped closures with up to 1 named parameter.\n* Coroutines, closures that can be paused and resumed.\n* Processes can run for more than one tick.\n* Ability to interface with digiline networks.\n\n## Experiments\n\n* Spawnable processes, enabling pre-emptive multitasking.\n* Introspective blocks for debug purposes, such as one to report a string representation of the call stack.\n\nThese features can be accessed through the 'Enable Experiments' setting. Some of these features can cause a lot of lag, even with the limits that have been imposed. Others are only useful for debugging purposes. Either way, don't enable these on a server!\n\nFirst-class continuations have been moved to their own mod, [SB2 Continuations](https://github.com/rdococ/sb2_continuations).",
