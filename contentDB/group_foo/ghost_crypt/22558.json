  "long_description": "# Ghost Crypt\n\nExplorers vs ghosts game. Ghosts are invisible unless\nyou shine magic light on them. They do most damage if they get behind you.\n\nUsage:\n\n- Start a new game using golden trophy.\n\nNote: This is a multiplayer game, you need at least two players to\nstart a match. Game will automatically end if there is not enough players\npresent on both teams. Testing server: `mt.cwiki.cyou:30002`\n\nPremise:\n\n- There is a group of explorers and group of ghosts.\n- Both are controlled by players.\n- When an explorer is captured by a ghost, they become a ghost\n- Ghosts are invisible to players by default, but players\n  have flashlights that, when directed at a ghost, make the ghost\n  lose health.\n- Explorers can collect treasures. But be careful, once you pick\n  a treasure, it's yours to keep (until your capture).\n- Treasures come in weird shapes. Use `rotate` button in your inventory\n  to rotate the shape.\n- Only explorers can collect treasures. As an explorer, your goal\n  is to fill your inventory with treasure of maximal value while\n  capturing or avoiding as many ghosts as you can.\n- As a ghost, your goal is to capture explorers. If you were an explorer\n  previously, you have an incentive to first capture players who have\n  the highest treasure count, so that they don't get more score then you\n  when you used to be an explorer.\n\nGame mechanics:\n\n- There is a large cost for activating light beam tool, and smaller cost for sustaining the light.\n- You can't destroy walls, but you can collect sand from sand piles.\n- Flowing sand can be crafted into sand source by placing 9 sands in the crafting grid.\n- Statues can be used to determine location of ghosts and explorers.\n  There are two types of statues. One of them looks at the closest\n  ghost, another looks at the closest explorer.\n- If you place a sand source at least two blocks above a player,\n  the player would not be able to escape unless they have a \"ghost miasma\"\n  node with them to stop the sand from flowing down.\n\nHints:\n\n- If you get lost, try drawing a map on a pice of paper\n\n## Building from source\nDependencies:\n\n- `GNU Make >= 4.4`\n- `Tiled >= 1.10`\n- `Python >= 3.11` with `Pillow >= 10.1`\n\nAfter installing the dependencies, run `make`\nto build all the required files.\n\n## Development\n\nTiled usage:\n\n- On exporting, make sure that \"Infinite\" map property is set to false.\n- `build_scripts/make_animations.py` uses Tiled animations\n  to generate multi-node textures.\n- You can set `min_players` (int) custom map property to set a limit\n  on the minimum number of connected players required for this map to be\n  chosen. Same for `max_players`.\n\nConverting sounds to mono:\n\n- `ffmpeg -i stereo.flac -ac 1 mono.flac`\n\nPrepend a name to all files in current directory:\n\n- `for f in *.png; do mv \"$f\" \"ghost_crypt_main_$f\"; done`\n\n## License\n\nCode: LGPLv2 or later\n\nFile: ghost_crypt_main.png\n\nSource: https://opengameart.org/content/dungeon-crawl-32x32-tiles-supplemental\n\nLicense: CC0\n\n\nFiles: ghost_crypt_main_step\\*.ogg\n\nSource: https://opengameart.org/content/9-wet-snow-steps\n\nLicense: CC0\n\nEverything else: own work, or modification of the above\n\nLicense: CC0\n",
