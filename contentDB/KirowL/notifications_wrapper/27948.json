  "long_description": "# Notification System API for Minetest\n___\n## Description\n\nThis project provides a simple Notification System API for Minetest mods. The goal is to create a temporary window that appears on the player's screen, displaying a message. This API can be called by any other mod to display various notifications, allowing for easy integration into multiple gameplay elements.\n\nFor example, if a player levels up in another mod, that mod can use this API to display the message \"You have leveled up!\" with the desired theme defined by the notification system.\n\n## Features\n\n* Customizable Messages: Display any message on the screen.\n* Duration Control: Set how long the notification will stay on the screen.\n* Modular: Can be called by any other mod to display notifications.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use the notification system, you can use the `notifications.queue(playerName, text, image, timeout)` function, provide the message, an optional icon, and the duration for which the notification should be displayed. This will render a notification on the specified player's screen.\n\nExample\n\n```lua\nnotifications.queue(\n    {\n        playerName = \"player_name\",\n        title = \"This is the title !\",\n        text = \"This is the notification content\",\n        image = \"my_background.jpg\",\n        timeout = 10\n    }\n)\n```\n\nThis function call will display a notification on the screen of the player naed `player_name` with the title `This is the title !`, the message `This is a test message !` and the background `my_background.jpg` for `10 seconds`.\nNote that the `my_background.jpg` needs to be located in the `notifications_wrapper/textures` folder. The recommended size is `800x200`.\n\n## Integration with Other Mods\n\n### How to display notifications from other mods ?\nTo use the notifications system in other mods, you will need to refer it as a dependency of your mod.\nIn your `depends.txt` file, just put the name of the mod : `notifications_wrapper`\n\nThen, in your code, you can use the `notifications` table and call the appropriate methods.\n\n### Basic example \nThis API can be used by other mods to trigger notifications based on in-game events. For instance, if a player earns a new level in a leveling mod, the notification system can be used to show a congratulatory message on the screen.\n\n```lua\nlocal function on_player_level_up(player)\n    if minetest.get_modpath(\"notifications_wrapper\") then\n        notifications.queue(\n            {\n                playerName = \"player_name\",\n                title = \"Level up !\",\n                text = \"Congratulations! You have reached level 5!\",\n                image = \"level_up_icon.png\",\n                timeout = 10\n            }\n        )\n    end\nend\n```\n\n## Installation \n\n* Copy the Lua script into your Minetest mod directory.\n* Load the API by requiring the script in your mod.\n* Use the provided methods to display notifications as needed.\n\n",
