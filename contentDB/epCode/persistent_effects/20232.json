  "long_description": "A minetest api that allows for easy creation of persistent effects. for example: changing a players health over time with a set interval (eg; poison or healing)\n\n### how to use:\nSimply use the one function\n```lua\npersistent_api.add_persistent_effect(def)\n```\nlike this\n```lua\npersistent_api.add_persistent_effect({\n  name = string,\n  -- effect identifier. Will be overwritten if another effect is added to the same object with the same identifier.\n\n  object = ObjectRef,\n  -- ObjectRef which is referenced and attached to the effect.\n\n  duration = float,\n  -- amount of time until the effect is removed.\n\n  effect = function(ObjectRef)\n  -- function that is run every time the effect is called.\n\n  persistence = float,\n  -- how often (in seconds) the effect function is run.\n})\n```\nfor example\n```lua\nlocal player = minetest.get_player_by_name(\"JohnSmith\")\n\n  persistent_api.add_persistent_effect({\n    name = \"damage_player\", -- identifier\n    object = player, -- affected object\n    duration = 10, -- this effect will last 10 seconds\n    effect = function(player)\n      player:set_hp(player:get_hp()-1) -- damage the player one half heart\n    end,\n    persistence = 0.1, -- every 0.1 seconds for 10 seconds the previous function will be run.\n  })\n```\n",
