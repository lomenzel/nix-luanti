  "long_description": "This is a very lightweight mod for creating and managing guilds.\n\n<h4>List of commands:</h4>\n\n* `/create_guild guild_name` creates the guild \"guild_name\" the guild_priv is needed for this.\n* `/my_guild` returns in wich guild you are who is the leader and wich rank you have.\n* `/join_guild guild_name` sends a join request to the guild guild_name.\n* `/accept player_name` accepts the player \"player_name\" in your guild. You have to be at least rank 5 to do this.\n* `/leave_guild` leaves the guild you are currently in. You cant do this as leader for now.\n* `/gm message` Sends a message to all guild mates.\n* `/gt player` Teleports to the player if the player is in the same guild\n* `/declare_war guild_name` Declare war to another guild.(The command just sends a message to all players of the other guild to meet in the pvp arena). You have to be at least rank 8 to do so.\n* `/promote player_name rank` This promotes the player to the given rank. You have to be at least one rank over the rank you want promote to.\n* `/list_guilds` Returns a list of all guilds.\n* `/guilds_menu` shows the guild menu\n\nI hope you enjoy the mod.\n\n<h4>Features:</h4>\n* Players can have different ranks with different privs\n* Message system between guild mates\n* Declare war to a guild\n* No friendly fire between guild members\n* A GUI\n\n<h4>Notes:</h4>\n* I think its clear but this mod is only usefull on servers.\n* If you want that everybody can create guilds just disable the privs line in the registration of \"/create_guild\".\n* After 2.0.0 the mod switched to player meta data and is therefore not compatible with earlier versions",
