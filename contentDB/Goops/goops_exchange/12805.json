  "long_description": "# Exchange\n\nThis mod adds a mechanism to inject currency into a server economy, as an alternative to the universal-basic-income feature of the currency mod. It is an interesting [idea of jonadab](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=4345&p=398541#p398541).\n\nI recommend to deactivate income mechanism (in currency) and interest mechanism (in atm, if loaded).\n\nThe mod adds a ``Trade counter'' node that allows to obtain minegeld from \"rare\" metals.\n\nGlooptest mod dependency was made optional by including part of its code.\n",
