  "long_description": "Gives the player access to a menu that lists all registered nodes giving the player full access to any block they want to use for building without having to go through unility blocks (like a form of crafting table) to access these blocks. This is mainly meant for creative mode and adds a way to get blocks eaisly in games that dont have a proper inventory system like nodecore.\n\nThis also allows server's that run games like nodecore to allow its staff or trusted members access to a creative mode \"inventory\" via a permission without completely replacing the base inventory screen and giving normal players access to infinite resources and blocks.",
