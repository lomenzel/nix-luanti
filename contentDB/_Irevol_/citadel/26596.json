Use both growth and decay to your advantage. Strategically position foliage in the past. Winner of the 2023 game jam. \n\n### Tips\n* Try to get to sparkly things!\n* When you first enter the ruins, walk towards the center, follow a path of black blocks, climb up a vine, walk along a wall, a drop onto a black, central pillar. \n* **There are 4 magic stones: You will need to find all of them to complete the game.**\n* There's something waiting at the top of the ruins...\n* Right click on the ghost to talk to it\n* There are 4 plants that grow in the ruins... perhaps you can use them?\n* There are 7 ancient artifacts in the ruins. Some of them are very difficult to get. They are simply collectables and not nessicary to complete the game.\n* Plants that have rubble fall on them are unlikely to grow\n* You can't time travel into a wall!\n\n### Want to get involved?\nJoin the [discord server](https://discord.gg/HQpacNUvDJ) or [matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/#citadel-minetest:matrix.org).\n\n","maintainers":["_Irevol_"],"media_license":"CC-BY-4.0","name":"citadel","provides":["citadel_core","citadel_timer","xpanes"],"release":26596,"repo":"https://github.com/Irevol/minetest-citadel.git","score":1896,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/79ce26c109.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/7096ff10a3.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/5a7c4a569a.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/6e51cd2127.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/786d72aafe.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/b2bf03a4f1.png"],"short_description":"A time-traveling puzzle game","state":"APPROVED","tags":["jam_game_2023","puzzle","singleplayer"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/79ce26c109.png","title":"Citadel","translation_url":null,"type":"game","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/_Irevol_/citadel/releases/26596/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"_Irevol_/citadel":[]},"hash":"0w6rs9miahs571p0m0akyhsvfnvpgx1hcl4rlglfbi1g0xijfk2k"}
