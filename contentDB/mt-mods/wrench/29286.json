It's now much more powerful, supporting many more mods, and is also safer to use.\n\n### Usage\n\nTo pick up nodes, simply punch them with the wrench (left-click). The picked-up node can then be placed as normal.\n\n### Supported Mods\n\nTo make maintaining support easier, wrench only supports specific versions of mods and their nodes. See [README.md](https://github.com/mt-mods/wrench/blob/master/README.md) for the full list. Other versions will likely be compatible, but support is only guaranteed for the versions listed.\n\n### API\n\nAn API is provided to add support for more nodes. See [API.md](https://github.com/mt-mods/wrench/blob/master/API.md) for details.","maintainers":["mt-mods","nixnoxus","OgelGames","-SX-","BuckarooBanzay","wsor4035"],"media_license":"CC-BY-SA-4.0","name":"wrench","provides":["wrench"],"release":29286,"repo":"https://github.com/mt-mods/wrench","score":325.2,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/710e98dc45.png"],"short_description":" Adds a wrench to pick up nodes with inventories, such as chests, and transport them to another location.","state":"APPROVED","tags":["building_mechanics","storage","tools"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/710e98dc45.png","title":"İngiliz anahtarı","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/mt-mods/wrench/releases/29286/download/","video_thumbnail_url":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/youtube/-DnBROIfsqY.jpg","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DnBROIfsqY","website":null,"dependencies":{"mt-mods/wrench":[]},"hash":"0f37pw930ynbpwz8rhr7azfq9p95b25z7r4aixj458gvx00kgx7y"}
