  "long_description": "# Travelnet\n\nEnhanced fork of the popular travelnet mod with additional color variants, cleanups and bugfixes\n\n## How this works\n\n- craft it by filling the right and left row with glass; place in the middle row (from top to bottom): steel, mese, steel\n- place the travelnet box somewhere\n- right-click on it; enter name of the station (e.g. \"my house\", \"center of desert city\") and name of the network (e.g. \"interesting towns\",\"my buildings\")\n- punch it to update the list of stations on that network\n- right-click to use the travelbox\n\nAn unconfigured travelnet box can be configured by anyone. If it is misconfigured, just dig it and place it anew.\nAll stations that have the same network name set and are owned by the same user connect to the same network.\n\n## Protected travelnet destinations\n\nA travelnet can be protected by prefixing the station name with \"(P)\".\nThe destination is only reachable then if the player accessing it can actually build there (depends on the protection mod).\n\n## Documentation\n\n* [API](https://github.com/mt-mods/travelnet/blob/master/doc/api.md)\n\n## License\n\nThe mod was written by me, Sokomine, and includes small contributions from other contributors.\nLicense: GPLv3 (see [`LICENSE`](https://github.com/mt-mods/travelnet/blob/master/LICENSE) for more information)\n\nThe models and textures as found in the textures/ and models/ folders where created by VanessaE\nand are provided under the [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license.\n\nExceptions:\n\n*  `textures/travelnet_top.png` [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game (`default_steel_block.png`)\n*  `textures/travelnet_bottom.png` [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game (`default_clay.png`)",
