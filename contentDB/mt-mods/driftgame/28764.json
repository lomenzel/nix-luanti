If a non-lightweght Lua mapgen is used it is best to pre-generate an area before driving in that area.\n\nUsing this game\n---------------\nDue to client->server->client control delay it is recommended that this game is used in singleplayer or in local multiplayer.\nGeneration of new areas of world may slightly affect the control response of the vehicle, the best control response will occur in previously generated areas.\nThird-person camera mode is recommended when driving for a better view.\n\nHow to start playing this game\n------------------------------\nStart a new world, the game will only allow 'Mapgen Flat' to be selected.\nThe optional features of Mapgen Flat: lakes and hills, should be left disabled.\n\nWhen you enter the world, if the screen is black you are probably inside a tree, walk in various directions to exit the tree.\n\nType '/grantme all' to obtain all privileges.\n\nPress 'K' to enable fly mode, and 'J' to enable fast mode.\n\nFly fast to find a road.\n\nPlace the car on the road, enter it. Press 'F7' to use third-person camera mode.\n\nCar controls\n------------\nLeft mouse button  = Place car in inventory when pointing at car.\nRight mouse button = Place car in world. Enter or exit car when pointing at car.\nForward            = Speed up.\n                     Slow down when moving backwards.\nBackward           = Slow down.\n                     Speed up when moving backwards.\nLeft               = Rotate anticlockwise.\nRight              = Rotate clockwise.\n\nHow this game was created\n-------------------------\nThis game is derived from my 'minipeli' game.\n\nMinipeli mods used unaltered:\ngui\nhand\nlight\nplayer_api\n\nMinipeli mods used and altered:\nmapgen (Remove sounds folder. Remove sounds tables. Remove river water nodes as mapgen valleys is unused.
