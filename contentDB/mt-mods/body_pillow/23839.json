  "long_description": "\nThis is the body_pillow mod, by Duane Robertson, written more as a training exercise than anything useful.\n\nYou create a body pillow with the following recipe:\n\tempty, white wool, empty\n\tred wool, green wool, blue wool\n\torange wool, violet wool, yellow wool\n\nIt looks nice and you can use it as a bed. The texture was made from public domain art available at the Open Clipart library (openclipart.org). However, it's easy to find better graphics with web search.\n\nTo turn the pillow over, (left) shift-click it, assuming you haven't remapped your sneak button.\n",
