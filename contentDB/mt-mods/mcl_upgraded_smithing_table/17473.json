  "long_description": "# Upgraded Smithing Tables for MineClone 2\nThis mod adds the ability to upgrade all the other tiers of tools and armor besides the usual diamond armor. Be warned though that it is not possible to upgrade leather armor. \n\nSupported upgrade items include:\n\n* Wood -> Stone\n\n* Chain Mail -> Iron\n\n* Stone -> Iron\n\n* Iron -> Gold\n\n* Gold -> Diamond\n\n* Diamond -> Netherite\n\n## API\nTo use these changes, you need to add the following lines to your definition.\n```lua\n_mcl_upgradable = true,\n_mcl_upgrade_item_material = \"mcl_nether:netherite_ingot\",\n_mcl_upgrade_item_name = {\"diamond\", \"netherite\"},\n```\nThis API relies on the item strings to be close other than the material name.\n\nReplace the `_mcl_upgrade_item_material` paramter to the upgrade material to use. For example, to upgrade a wood sword to stone sword, this paramater would be \"mcl_core:cobble\". The upgrade material should also be in the `upgrade_material` group for this to work.\n\nReplace the `_mcl_upgrade_item_name` paramter in the following pattern: first part is the material type for item the line is in; while the second line is the material type of the upgraded item. For example, to upgrade a wood sword to stone sword, the defintion would be `{\"wood\", \"stone\"}`.\n\n## License\nGNU General Public License\n\n## Credits\nSpecial thank you to Fleckentstein and Code-Sploit for writing the original mcl_smithing_table mod.\n\n## Contributing\nFound a bug or want a mod to work with this mod?
