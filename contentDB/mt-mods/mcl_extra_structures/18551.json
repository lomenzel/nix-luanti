Includes structures based on YouTube videos about what could be in future Minecraft updates. This will hopefully be continuously updated and expanded.\n\nStructure List\n--------------\n* Oasis (PrairieWind)\n* Birch Forest Temple Ruins (PrairieWind)\n* Brick Pyramid (PrairieWind)\n* Graveyard (PrairieWind)\n* Loggers Camp (Cora)\n* Sandstone Obelisks (Michieal)\n* Ice Tower (PrairieWind)\n\nDisabling Specific Structures\n-----------------------------\nIn the minetest.conf file, create a new line (if it doesn't already exist) called `mcl_disabled_structures` and list the structures you wish to disable with each structure seperated by a comma.\nExample: `mcl_disabled_structures = desert_oasis, brick_pyramid`\n\nContributing\n------------\nIf you wish to contribute a structure, create a schematic of the structure and upload it in an issue. If you are knowledgeable about the mineclone2 structure api, git, and coding, create a pull request with the code and schematics.","maintainers":["mt-mods"],"media_license":"GPL-3.0-or-later","name":"mcl_extra_structures","provides":["mcl_extra_structures"],"release":18551,"repo":"https://github.com/mt-mods/mcl_extra_structures.git","score":361.3,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/262d764146.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/d43eb01974.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/dfc867825d.png"],"short_description":"Adds extra structures to MineClone2","state":"APPROVED","tags":["mapgen"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/262d764146.png","title":"Extra Structures for MineClone 2","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/mt-mods/mcl_extra_structures/releases/18551/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"mt-mods/mcl_extra_structures":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"mcl_structures","packages":["Wuzzy/mineclone2","VoxelForge/voxelforge","ryvnf/mineclonia"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"mcl_enchanting","packages":["Wuzzy/mineclone2","VoxelForge/voxelforge","ryvnf/mineclonia"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"mcl_loot","packages":["VoxelForge/voxelforge","Wuzzy/mineclone2","ryvnf/mineclonia"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"mcl_init","packages":["Wuzzy/mineclone2","VoxelForge/voxelforge","ryvnf/mineclonia"]}]},"hash":"12d0qbh975cv8hbclbzd3licphikbha7d5dadjpkjy828s1wq7m1"}
