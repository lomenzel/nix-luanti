  "long_description": "# sprint_lite\nConfigurable and easy-to use sprinting mod that supports hudbars and hbhunger. Designed after [hbsprint](https://github.com/minetest-mods/hbsprint/) by Tacotexmex.  \nhbsprint is great, however there's a few bugs, so I decided to write my own \"vision\" of this mod.\n\n![Screenshot](screenshot.png)\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Minetest 5.0.0 (Wasn't tested on previous versions but might work)\n- [player_monoids](https://github.com/minetest-mods/player_monoids)\n- [hudbars](https://repo.or.cz/w/minetest_hudbars.git) (optional, but strongly recommended. You won't have a hud indicator without it)\n- [hbhunger](https://repo.or.cz/w/minetest_hbhunger.git) (optional)\n\n## Conficts\nConflicts with hbsprint\n\n## How to use\nHold \"special\" key to sprint (by default it's assigned to E).  \nWhile sprinting, your stamina will decrease, until it hits 0 and you'll no longer be able to sprint.  \nIf your stamina is lower than a threshold (specified in settingtypes), then you can't start sprinting.  \n\n## Settingtypes\nMod can be configured by changing settings in Settings->All Settings->Mods->sprint_lite, or by putting them directly to your minetest.conf:\n\n```\nsprint_lite_max_stamina = 20\nMaximum stamina of every player\n\nsprint_lite_speed_multiplier = 1.75\nSpeed multiplier when sprinting\n\nsprint_lite_jump_multiplier = 1.25\nJump multiplier when sprinting\n\nsprint_lite_step_interval = 0.15\nServer step interval in seconds, when performing sprint-related checks\n\nsprint_lite_drain_hunger = true\nSprinting drains hunger, if hbhunger is installed\n\nsprint_lite_hunger_amount = 0.03\nAmount of hunger to drain per step\n\nsprint_lite_stamina_drain = 0.5\nAmount of stamina to drain per step\n\nsprint_lite_stamina_regen = 0.1\nAmount of stamina to regenerate per step, when not running\n\nsprint_lite_stamina_threshold = 8\nAmount of stamina below which you can't start running\n\nsprint_lite_spawn_particles = true\nSpawn particles under sprinting players\n\nsprint_lite_require_ground = false\nRequire ground to run\n```\n\n## Integration with other mods\nMod provides two public functions:\n\n```\nsprint_lite.set_stamina(name, amount, add)\nname - string, name of the player\namount - float, amount of stamina to add/set (can be negative if \"add\" is true, can't be otherwise)\nadd - bool, should \"amount\" be added or set\n\nfunction returns new stamina amount of the player, returns false if failed to set stamina\n\nsprint_lite.get_stamina(name)\nname - string, name of the player\n\nfunction returns amount of stamina of the player, returns false if failed\n```\n\n\n## License\nAll code is licensed under GPLv3 [link to the license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)  \nAll resources are licensed under CC BY 4.0 [link to the license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode)  \n",
