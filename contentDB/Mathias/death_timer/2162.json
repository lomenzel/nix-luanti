  "long_description": "Adds a delay between each death, to mitigate abuse of respawn, teleportation to a predefined area, playing recklessly, but allows user to take breaks in between in the case of the death. Maybe it also provides an alternative to losing items on death. Optimized for 5.0.0-5.4.0.\n\nCredits to Coder12 for being original developer of mod.\n\nTo change the delay time, go to init.lua file and change the number value located near the top of the script for:\n*local initial_timeout*\n\nAwards/Achievements\n\nArctic Code Vault Contributor Selectee, 2020",
