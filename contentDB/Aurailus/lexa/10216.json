  "long_description": "**Deprecated:** this package doesn't reach the minimum content requirement, but has been kept on CDB anyway because it's a gamejam entry\n\nUnfortunately, this ended up very unfinished. Time management is a bitch, right? Anyways, to play, **move the `map` file from the game folder into your your `worlds` folder and use that.**\n\nKNOWN ISSUES I DIDNT HAVE TIME TO FIX\n- Junctions don't work\n- Turrets don't work\n- Enemies spawn, but don't attack or get damaged. Instant-kill from punching\n\nSTUFF THAT DOES WORK\n- Resources\n- Cool custom hud\n- Mining and conveyoring ores into the inputs",
