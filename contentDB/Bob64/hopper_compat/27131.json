  "long_description": "This mod enhances the functionality of hoppers in Minetest by enabling compatibility with various containers and machines from other mods. \n\n**Support for Connected Chests**: As of release v2.0.0, hoppers can now interact with connected chests, opening up new possibilities for item storage and transfer.\n\nPlease note that this mod is currently under development. While every effort is made to ensure smooth operation, there may be occasional issues. Your patience and feedback are greatly appreciated.\n\nWARNING:  Connected_chest support only works with FaceDeer's version of the hoppers mod which can be found here: https://content.minetest.net/packages/FaceDeer/hopper/ .\nAll other functionality should still work with tenplus1's version but I havn't tested it.\n\nRelease v2.0.0 to v2.0.4 use some code from FaceDeer's version of the hopper mod in order to make item transfer work between connected chests. See readme.md for details.",
