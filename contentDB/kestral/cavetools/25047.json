If the lack of ladder thickness bothers you, you can use Linuxdirks [redef](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Linuxdirk/redef) mod, which provides 3-d ladders.\n- The [ropes](https://content.minetest.net/packages/FaceDeer/ropes) mod by FaceDeer has a similar option for ladders, but extends them upward. Cave Tools' ladder override will conflict with this, but can be disabled (see configuration below).\n\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nEach separate feature can be selectively enabled or disabled in the minetest.conf file.\n\n- cavetool_flashlamps = **true**/false\n- cavetool_depthfinders = **true**/false\n- cavetool_ladders = **true**/false\n\n\nDependencies\n-------------\n- Ladder overrides only enabled if **default** exists.\n- Craft recipes only available if **default** and **tnt** exist.\n- Wand also optionally depends on **mana**.\n\n\nCraft recipes\n-------------\n\nSee [github](https://github.com/kestral246/cavetools) for craft recipe images.\n","maintainers":["kestral"],"media_license":"CC-BY-SA-3.0","name":"cavetools","provides":["cavetools"],"release":25047,"repo":"https://github.com/kestral246/cavetools","score":3.8,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/dfcc417915.png"],"short_description":"A collection of tools that can be useful for exploring caves.","state":"APPROVED","tags":["tools"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/dfcc417915.png","title":"Cave Tools","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/kestral/cavetools/releases/25047/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"kestral/cavetools":[]},"hash":"166pg5lc9d7ib2zwcf9n1anvpjqxpyhv2mrc2awvmsh38lhy9xmy"}
