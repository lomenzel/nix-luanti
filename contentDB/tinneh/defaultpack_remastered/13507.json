  "long_description": "_A remastered version of the Minetest Game default texture pack._\n\n ~ It aims for a smoother and realistic look which still is pretty much based on the defaultpack.\n\nCause in general I like the realistic and rather simple style, there are some textures I really love (above all the permafrost nodes). But some others tend to be a bit expressionless, with no real substance or structure - for example dirt - and some just have weird colors (Sand(stone) has a greenish tint to it?!).\n\nSo for most of the textures I only minimized the color palette and shifted color shades a bit to overall have a uniform look:\n\n## Status\n\nContains so far:\n\n - default (~39%)\n - unified_inventory\n\n## ToDo\n\n- [ ] Complete the textures for default mod\n- [ ] Do the rest ðŸ‘Œ\n- [ ] ...and then also provide all the licensing informations\n",
