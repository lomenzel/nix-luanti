  "long_description": "# DlxTrains ModPack\n*Important: The current version of DlxTrains ModPack requires AdvTrains 2.4.0 or later*\n\nDlxTrains ModPack is an extension for AdvTrains that adds train related content.  Features of the modpack include:\n\n- Detailed locomotives and wagons whose livery and age appearance can be selected by the owning player.\n- 3 diesel locomotives with dynamic sound, smoke and texture effects.\n- 17 industrial freight wagons, including some that have visible loads that reflect the wagon's inventory.\n- 2 support wagons, including an escort wagon and a caboose.\n- Basic support for [AdvTrains Livery Tools](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Marnack/advtrains_livery_tools/).\n- Tank wagon support for [Techage Modpack](https://content.luanti.org/packages/joe7575/techage_modpack/) when used with [Advanced Trains TechAge addons](https://content.luanti.org/packages/orwell/advtrains_techage/).\n\nNote: This modpack does not currently include passenger wagons. For those, consider using [AdvTrains Basic Trains](https://content.luanti.org/packages/orwell/basic_trains/), [Moretrains](https://content.luanti.org/packages/gpcf/moretrains/) or [Classic Coaches](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Marnack/classic_coaches/), all of which are available on [ContentDB](https://content.luanti.org/).\n\n## Included mods\n\nPlease see the README file in each of the included mod folders for important additional information.\n\n- **DlxTrains** - This is the base mod needed by all other DlxTrains related mods.  It contains common craft items and tools for the modpack plus utilities needed by the other DlxTrains mods.\n- **DlxTrains Cargo** - This is an optional mod that adds some cargo nodes as well as additional cargo related textures that can be used by the DlxTrains Industrial Wagons mod.\n- **DlxTrains Diesel Locomotives** - This mod provides three diesel locomotives in multiple liveries.  Players can optionally customize the exterior of these locomotives with a visible unit number that is unique to each locomotive.\n- **DlxTrains Industrial Wagons** - This mod provides freight wagons that feature selectable liveries and, in some cases, visible cargo.\n- **DlxTrains Support Wagons** - This mod provides support wagons, including an escort wagon and a caboose, both of which provide additional seating for train crew members.  These wagons also feature selectable liveries.\n\n## Game Support\nAs with **AdvTrains**, DlxTrains ModPack is compatible with many games when playing in creative mode and fully supports survival mode in [Minetest Game](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Minetest/minetest_game/) and its many variants.  However, DlxTrains ModPack also supports survival mode in games that are not based on **Minetest Game** including the following:\n\n- [Farlands Reloaded](https://content.luanti.org/packages/wsor4035/farlands_reloaded/)\n- [Hades Revisited](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Wuzzy/hades_revisited/)\n- [Minecloneia](https://content.luanti.org/packages/ryvnf/mineclonia/)\n- [VoxeLibre](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Wuzzy/mineclone2/) (formerly known as MineClone2)\n\nNote that support for survival mode in those games is subject to potential breakage in the future if those games change their materials or crafting system.\n\nSome of the crafting recipes defined by DlxTrains require items that are defined in AdvTrains.  Thus, for full support of survival mode in the games listed above, also consider using the [AdvTrains Crafting Compatibility Patch](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Marnack/advtrains_crafting_compatibility_patch/) to enable crafting of those items that are defined in AdvTrains.\n\n## Recent Changes\n### [1.19.0] - 2025-06-14\n - Add second driver stand to the European G1206 Diesel Locomotive\n - Add two European small open wagons\n - Remove unnecessary MTL files\n - Add conversion recipes for the European small tank wagons\n - Reduce inventory capacity of the European small tank wagons\n    > *NOTE: See the relevant wagon descriptions in the README file in the dlxtrains_industrial_wagons mod folder for an important note about excess cargo in existing wagons.*\n - Update livery count for the North American Wooden Boxcar in the README file\n - Add notes about inventory for the European small open wagons\n### [1.18.0] - 2025-01-20\n - Optimize PNGs\n### [1.17.0] - 2024-11-15\n - Change references from Minetest to Luanti\n - Add Australian Cattle Van\n - Minor code cleanup\n - Refactor common tool code\n\nPlease see the CHANGELOG in the modpack folder for older changes.\n",
