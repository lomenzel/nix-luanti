  "long_description": "This mod allows to set RPG-like texts for NPC where the NPC \"says\" something\nto the player and the player can reply with a selection of given replies -\nwhich most of the time lead to the next dialog.\n\nOriginal author: AliasAlreadyTaken/aka Bastrabun  \nMassive rewrite/extension: Sokomine\n\n## Recommended mods\n\nIn order to be able to edit the dialogs of the NPC ingame, please install\n<a href=\"https://content.luanti.org/packages/Sokomine/npc_talk_edit/\">npc_talk_edit</a>.\nThe only situation where you might not need this extra mod is when you\ndesign your own adventure game and your players are not expected to edit\nthe NPC.\n\nOptional dependency:\n<a href=\"https://content.luanti.org/packages/TenPlus1/mobs/\">mobs_redo</a>\nis highly recommended. You may be able to use other mob mods with\nmanual adjustments as well (This is for very advanced users).\n\nThis mod here does not provide any NPC as such. You need a mod that does so.\nThe mod <a href=\"https://content.luanti.org/packages/Sokomine/npc_talk/\">npc_talk</a> adds the actual NPC.\nIt is highly recommended to use `npc_talk` or to create your own according to your needs.\n\nYou might also wish to use <a href=\"https://content.luanti.org/packages/TenPlus1/mobs_npc/\">mobs_npc</a>\nfrom TenPlus1 as that mod provides very useful actual NPC and will be used by\n<a href=\"https://content.luanti.org/packages/Sokomine/npc_talk/\">npc_talk</a> if installed.\n\nTo get started, best install `yl_speak_up`, `npc_talk_edit`, `npc_talk`, `mobs_redo` and `mobs_npc` in your world.\n\nFor documentation, see <a href=\"https://gitea.your-land.de/Sokomine/yl_speak_up/src/branch/master/readme.md\">readme.md</a>.",
