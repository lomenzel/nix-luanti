Like a normal church bell which used to be found in many German villages and town halls, it sounds as many times as the hour calls for.\n\nIn emergencies (i.e. mobs attacking en mass), players may ring the bell manually.\n\nThe normal bell that chimes the hour ought to be placed by moderators only in order to avoid spam. I've added a version of the bell that looks the same, can actually be crafted, can still be ringed manually (hear distance is smaller), but does not chime the hour automaticly.\n\nImportant: You have to add your own sounds. Just create a folder sounds/ in the mod's directory and drop files bell_bell.ogg and bell_small.ogg in it.","maintainers":["Sokomine"],"media_license":"CC-BY-SA-3.0","name":"bell","provides":["bell"],"release":398,"repo":"https://github.com/Sokomine/bell","score":474.6,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/R8UutOls5R.jpg","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/smS8Kif230.jpg","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/hiG27kkOCe.jpg"],"short_description":"A bell that sounds each hour - like a historic bell in a church or town hall","state":"APPROVED","tags":["building","sound_music","technology"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/R8UutOls5R.png","title":"Bell","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/Sokomine/bell/releases/398/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"Sokomine/bell":[]},"hash":"1r6fqhm54rjq3ql42asjm0rkczqlrqvri09i6pzbnzc0anf54da0"}
