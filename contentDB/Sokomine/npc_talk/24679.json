They can be talked to on rightclick.\n\n## Table of Content\n\n1. [Basic talking NPC (no other mods required)](#talking_npc)\n2. [Talking to blocks (no other mods required)](#talk_sign)\n3. [Example NPC (requires mobs\\_redo)](#mobs_redo)\n4. [Talk to existing NPC (requires mobs\\_npc)](#mobs_npc)\n5. [Talk to animals (requires mobs\\_animal)](#mobs_animal)\n6. [More information](#misc)\n\n\n### 1. Basic talking NPC (no other mods required)<a name=\"talking_npc\"></a>\n\nThis basic NPC is available even if you install no other mods.\n\nThe model - `character.b3d` - is part of `minetest_game`. You can either get it from there\n(you will likely have it already) or change the entry in `talking_npc.lua` to the model\nyour game uses. You will also need a texture called `character.png`.\n\nThere is no spawning implemented. Type `/giveme npc_talk:talking_npc` to get one.\n\nFeatures:\n* These NPC can be talked to on right-click.\n* They look at the player when right-clicked.\n* They can be picked up through a menu entry in their talk menu.\n* The picked up NPC can be placed again. \n* Add more textures to the table `yl_speak_up.mob_skins[\"npc_talk:talking_npc\"]` in order to have more diffrent textures.\n\n\n### 2. Talking to blocks (no other mods required)<a name=\"talk_sign\"></a>\n\nWith a mese block and a wooden sign, you can craft a special sign which you can place\nand that will act like an NPC.\n\nThis feature is highly experimental.\n\nThe position of the sign acts as ID.\n\n\n\n### 3. Example NPC (requires mobs\\_redo)<a name=\"mobs_redo\"></a>\n\nThis is very close to the NPC used on the Your Land server. They're basicly\n`mobs_redo` based NPC. You also need to install the `skinsdb` mod so that\na mesh and textures are available. Technicly, `skinsdb` isn't really\nnecessary - but a mesh and textures are. They have to come from *somewhere*.\n\nThere is no spawning implemented. Type `/giveme npc_talk:npc` to get one.\n\nFeatures:\n* These NPC can be talked to on right-click.\n* They turn around randomly (`mobs_redo` handles that).\n* They can be picked up with a lasso.\n* The picked up NPC show up as eggs in your inventory and can be placed again. \n* You can add more textures by creating a folder named `textures` in the folder of this mod and adding skins (MineCraft compatible) to that folder. The filenames have to start with `npc_talk_main_`. Capes are also supported.\n\n\n### 4. Talk to existing NPC (requires mobs\\_npc)<a name=\"mobs_npc\"></a>\n\nThese mobs come from a mod that already adds some NPC. They spawn in the world,\ncan be tamed with bread, and you can even breed them. Said mod is called\n`mobs_npc`.\n\nJust right-click them to talk to and use all other features as you're used to\nfrom that mod.\n\n\n### 5. Talk to animals (requires mobs\\_animal)<a name=\"mobs_animal\"></a>\n\nThis is more for fun. You can craft a special _talk tool_ by combining a lasso and\nshears together. Punch animals (only white sheep, red sheep and cows are supported)\nwith that tool in order to be able to _talk_ to them.\n\nSo far, neither the sheep nor the cows had much to tell me. But perhaps you'll\nbe more lucky!\n\nThe reason why you need the _talk tool_ here and can't just right-click them\nis because these mobs have special functions on rightclick (feeding etc.) and\nno interface to add new functionality there. This method - using such a tool -\nshows how you can deal with such situations. You might of course also edit\nthe sheeps and cows and/or talk to TenPlus1 to get that integrated. But animals\nseldom have much to say, so it's probably not of much interest to most players.\n\n\n### 6. More information<a name=\"misc\"></a>\n\nAs you can see, this mod is mostly a demonstration of what you can do. Plus it\ndoes provide some usable NPC. Please select what you like and customize them!\n\nNPC really love talking.\n\nIf you have questions, feel free to contact me on the forum or on IRC.\n\nSokomine\n",
