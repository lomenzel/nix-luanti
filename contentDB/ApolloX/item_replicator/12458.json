(However there is a graphical issue in the formspec which adds some difficulty in navigation)\n\n## Quick-Start\n\n1. Get this repo! (Or mod)\n2. Drop this directory/repo into your Minetest mods folder.\n3. Edit settings.lua to your liking.\n4. Add `load_mod_item_replicator = true` to your worlds world .mt file.\n5. Enjoy the mod.\n\n## A note about logging\n\nThis mod can dump a lot of information out to your log file (`debug.txt`).\n\nPlease turn off the following settings like so, below:\n\n```lua\nitem_replicator_settings.log_api = false\nitem_replicator_settings.log_production = false -- Only turn this one off if really needed\nitem_replicator_settings.log_deep = false\n```\n\n## A note about items\n\nThis mod tracks a lot of information about items.\n\nFrom it's itemstring to it's amount produced per process, or even the time between processes.\n\nIt may be easier for your server to simply run with allow_unknown to be true (on).\n\nThis will simply use the other settings below that (unknown_item_time, unknown_item_amount) when it encounters an unknown item.\n\nOr for those who wish to better my mod and the community using it, please consider making a Pull Request with your additions/changes.\n(See [mod_support.lua](https://github.com/Beanzilla/item_replicator/blob/v1.0/mod_support.lua) for further details)\n\n## Mods supported\n\n* MTG default\n* MCL (Well the basic stuff in MCL anyway)\n* [area_containers](https://content.luanti.org/packages/jwmhjwmh/area_containers/)\n",
