Go ahead and get your area picked out for where you want your mine.\n2. Then issue `/mines create <mine_name>` (Please note, mine names must be all one word, **No Spaces**, and they can't be named a `/mines` subcommand)\n3. It will show a list of additional commands which can be issued to set the many things to the mine then issue `/mines active <mine_name>`\n",
