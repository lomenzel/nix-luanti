  "long_description": "# Nutra Paste\n\nFree but poor quality food source.\n\nThe concept is from the game [Rimworld](https://rimworldgame.com/)\n\n## How it works\n\nOnce you get wood you can make a Nutra Paste Machine, this block once placed will produce Nutra Paste. Nutra Paste is a meal which provides\n half a hunger point or half a hit point of food, thus making it not prefered, but can be used to keep you alive.\n\n## What to change something\n\nMost of the settings you'll want to change are contained within settings.lua so just edit the file and restart your client/server.\n\n### What's in settings.lua\n\n* `amount_per_production`, How many Nutra Paste meals do all machines make per production?\n\n* `time_per_production`, How frequent do Nutra Paste Machines produce meals?\n\n* `log_production`, In case you wanted/need to get some extra debug on what is happening. (This should be false on servers and more stable/long running environments)\n\n* `craft`, Can any player craft a Nutra Paste Machine to make meals with?\n\n## How to make it\n```\nW = Wood Planks (Uses groups so any wood planks will work)\nS = Sapling (Uses groups so any sapling will work)\n\n_  W _\nW S W\n_  W _\n```",
