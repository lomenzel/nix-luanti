  "long_description": "3 tools in 1.\n\nTo switch using 'auto-switch', just right click on the designated node you want to break, the tool will switch to the correct tool that can mine it the fastest.\n\n> You can manually switch via holding the SNEAK (default left shift) while right clicking (on either a node or air) to cycle thru (in the pattern of Axe -> Pickaxe -> Shovel -> Axe).\n\nPlease note however, the tool shares it's durability among all 3 states. (As such it comes with a hefty durability)\n\nThe tool tries not to interfere with nodes like doors, chests, and other nodes that might have a use on right click (like opening an inventory or formspec)\n\nThe Pickaxe can now mine invisible walls from mods like [invisible_wall by X17](https://content.minetest.net/packages/X17/invisible_wall/).\n\nThe tool can now be used with [toolranks by lisacvuk](https://content.minetest.net/packages/lisacvuk/toolranks/).\n",
