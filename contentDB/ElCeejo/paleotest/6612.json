This mod aims for a Zoo Tycoon type experience, with creatures being capable of escaping and players having to ensure their Dinosaurs mood and hunger don't drop too low.\n\n# Dinosaurs\n- Tyrannosaurus\n- Spinosaurus\n- Carnotaurus\n- Velociraptor\n- Brachiosaurus\n- Triceratops\n- Stegosaurus\n\n# Mammals\n- Mammoth\n- Elasmotherium\n- Procoptodon\n- Smilodon\n- Thylacoleo\n\n# Reptiles\n- Mosasaurus\n- Elasmosaurus\n- Pteranodon\n- Sarcosuchus\n\n# Fish\n- Dunkleosteus\n\n# Plants\n- Cycad\n- Horsetails\n- Metasequoia \n\n---\n\n# Caring for animals:\n\n### Mood\n\nA mobs mood is important to keep track of. If it gets too low the mob will become aggressive towards it's owner and won't obey orders, and some larger mobs may destroy blocks (if the option is enabled). To keep mobs happy, include a Scratching Post and/or Pursuit Ball in their enclosure.\n\n### Hunger\n\nA mobs hunger is also important. If it gets too low the mob will begin taking damage until it reach about 1/3 it's maximum health, and it's mood will begin to lower. To keep mobs fed you can feed them by hand or keep a Feeder in their enclosure. Mobs have differing diets so it's important to make sure you have the right feeder in their enclosure. To check the mobs diet, right-click it with the Prehistoric Field Guide.\n\n---\n\n# Cloning Mobs\n\n### Getting Fossils\n\nThe first step in cloning a PaleoTest mob is getting Fossils. Fossils spawn somewhat deep underground and drop a variety of items when dug. The item you want to clone a mob are Fossils or Ancient Bones\n\n### Getting DNA\n\nOnce you have Fossils or Ancient Bones you can attempt to get DNA.  To get DNA you'll need the Fossil Analyzer. Once you've obtained the Fossil Analyzer, you can insert Fossils or Ancient Bones and wait a few seconds for it to finish analyzing. Once this is finished, the output can be a few different items, most of the time you'll get Sand or Gravel, but if you're lucky you'll get DNA.\n\n### Turning DNA into a mob\n\nNow that you have DNA, you'll need a DNA Cultivator. Once you've obtained the DNA Cultivator, you can insert the DNA and it will begin cultivating. After a few seconds you'll have one of three possible item types: Egg, Embryonic Sac, and Syringe.\n\n### Eggs\n\nEggs can be hatched by placing them down next to any block that light levels equal to a torch. You can monitor the eggs progress with the Prehistoric Field Guide. After a while the egg will begin to move. Shortly after that, the egg will hatch.\n\n### Embryonic Sacs\n\nEmbryonic Sacs are simple, just right-click the ground and the mob will pop out.\n\n### Syringes\n\nSyringes are used by right-clicking a supported surrogate mob (currently only supports a few mammals from petz). Once you've right-clicked the surrogate you can monitor the pregnancy progress with the Prehistoric Field Guide. After a while the mob will be born.\n\n---\n\n# Supported Mods\n\n### Petz\nCertain creatures from Petz can be impregnated via syringe and all meats from petz can be used as food\n\n### Mobs Redo\nMeat from Mobs Redo can be used as food\n\n---\n","maintainers":["ElCeejo"],"media_license":"GPL-3.0-only","name":"paleotest","provides":["paleotest"],"release":6612,"repo":"https://github.com/ElCeejo/paleotest","score":830.1,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/rZckYC4FfU.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/z0UxVC9AiZ.png"],"short_description":"Adds Prehistoric Fauna and Flora to Minetest Game","state":"APPROVED","tags":["building","crafting","education","environment","mobs","plants_and_farming","pve","technology"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/rZckYC4FfU.png","title":"PaleoTest","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/ElCeejo/paleotest/releases/6612/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"ElCeejo/paleotest":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"walls","packages":["Noodlemire/voxeldungeon","sunnysideup/holidayhorrors","1248/castrum","Minetest/minetest_game","1248/regnum","carlos_rupp/berzerkpt","1248/regnum2","miroptics/qiskitblocks_miro","Casimir/voxelgarden","JavaFXpert/qiskitblocks","bell07/whynot_game","Kimapr/nonsensical_skyblock","Big_Caballito/no_mans_land","MeseCraft/mesecraft","TheFanne/raining_nodes","PetiAPocok/minetest_extended","hilol/epic_combat","EmptyStar/asuna","rubenwardy/capturetheflag","mt-mods/dreambuilder_game"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"mob_core","packages":["talas/colourhop","mt-mods/mob_core"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"mobkit","packages":["mt-mods/mobkit","benrob0329/ikea","Hi_World/newplanet","Noodlemire/voxeldungeon","talas/colourhop","wsor4035/minekart","nurd3/ul_game","Lone_Wolf/voxel_knights","Mantar/exile","wsor4035/farlands_reloaded"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"stairs","packages":["Noodlemire/voxeldungeon","Amaz/lordofthetest","rheo/moreblocks","1248/castrum","zanderdev/skyblock_zero","Minetest/minetest_game","carlos_rupp/berzerkpt","1248/regnum","mt-mods/blockcolor","1248/regnum2","miroptics/qiskitblocks_miro","TenPlus1/stairs","KareaGhandTrail/block_assault_mapmaker","KareaGhandTrail/block_assault","Casimir/voxelgarden","Luanti/devtest","Mantar/exile","Kimapr/nonsensical_skyblock","JavaFXpert/qiskitblocks","jgordon510/gridlocks","bell07/whynot_game","Big_Caballito/no_mans_land","TheFanne/raining_nodes","rlars/occupymoon_game","PetiAPocok/minetest_extended","MeseCraft/mesecraft","hilol/epic_combat","EmptyStar/asuna","mt-mods/dreambuilder_game","rubenwardy/capturetheflag"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"default","packages":["AiTechEye/xaenvironment","Hi_World/newplanet","Noodlemire/voxeldungeon","JALdMIC/survivethedays","sunnysideup/holidayhorrors","BuckarooBanzay/mesecons_lab","nam/porko","Amaz/lordofthetest","1248/castrum","Thunder1035/etb","1248/regnum","Minetest/minetest_game","debiankaios/proxima_survival","carlos_rupp/berzerkpt","1248/regnum2","miroptics/qiskitblocks_miro","KareaGhandTrail/block_assault_mapmaker","KareaGhandTrail/block_assault","Casimir/voxelgarden","bell07/whynot_game","JavaFXpert/qiskitblocks","Kimapr/nonsensical_skyblock","jgordon510/gridlocks","giga-turbo/codecube","niwla23/runorfall","Thunder1035/pacman","Big_Caballito/no_mans_land","MeseCraft/mesecraft","hilol/epic_combat","TheFanne/raining_nodes","rlars/occupymoon_game","PetiAPocok/minetest_extended","mooD_Slayer/ksurvive","EmptyStar/asuna","mt-mods/dreambuilder_game","rubenwardy/capturetheflag"]}],"mt-mods/mob_core":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"mobkit","packages":["mt-mods/mobkit","benrob0329/ikea","Hi_World/newplanet","Noodlemire/voxeldungeon","talas/colourhop","wsor4035/minekart","nurd3/ul_game","Lone_Wolf/voxel_knights","Mantar/exile","wsor4035/farlands_reloaded"]}],"mt-mods/mobkit":[],"rheo/moreblocks":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"fmod","packages":["rheo/fmod","zanderdev/skyblock_zero"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"futil","packages":["zanderdev/skyblock_zero","rheo/futil"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"unified_inventory","packages":["BuckarooBanzay/mesecons_lab","Hi_World/newplanet","RealBadAngel/unified_inventory","BRNSystems/blocky_portaling","PyuDev/pyutest","joe7575/techage_modpack","zanderdev/skyblock_zero","KareaGhandTrail/block_assault_mapmaker","MisterE/blockbomber_editor","mt-mods/dreambuilder_game"]}]},"hash":"0nhycnj4zn8nc2qa7714a4qs9wqs0bkpcjykqknp1i0150zall2i"}
