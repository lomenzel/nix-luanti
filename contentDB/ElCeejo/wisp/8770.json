  "long_description": "Wisps are a non-entity, flame-like mob. They spawn near trees and can be caught with Jars. Catching them is not easy, as they will flee when a player is too close and can phase through solid blocks when chased.\n\nAfter being caught with a Jar, the Jar can be placed and will provide benefits to the environment around them.\n\n**Red Wisps** in Jars will destroy all plants in a 10x10x10 area, making them useful for keeping weeds away, but also dangerous to gardens.\n\n**Green Wisps** in Jars will accelerate growth of plants in a 10x10x10 area, there is no constant rate, so it may take the plants no longer than usual to grow, or they could fully grow within seconds.\n\n**Blue Wisps** in Jars will prevent fires in a 10x10x10 area, making them useful for protecting flammable builds.\n\nIf you want to spawn a wisp, use the /add_wisp command. You can specifiy a color(red, green, or blue), but if you don't a random color will be picked.\n\nIf you want to clear all wisps (excluding those in Jars), use the /clear_wisps command.\n\nThis mod is W.I.P, and will be taking the back burner as other projects are more important.",
