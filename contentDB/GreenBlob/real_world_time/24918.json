  "long_description": "# Real World Time\nReal World Time is a Minetest mod that syncs in-game time with the real-world time, so that the time in the game will always be the same as the time in real life. As a result, the day-night cycle will sync with the real-world one and will cycle at the same speed as the real world.\n\n## How it works\nIf enabled, this mod syncs the time of your world with your system clock and adjusts the game's time-speed to be the same as the real-world. Then, it verifies every 60 seconds to make sure the time is properly synced.\n\n## Commands\nTo manually sync the time with the real-world time, run:\n```\n/sync_time\n```\n\nTo stop syncing and restore the default time speed, run:\n```\n/unsync_time\n```\n> The `server` priv is required to run the commands.\n\n## Disabling the Mod\nTo disable this mod and not sync the time anymore, run `/unsync_time`, close the world, and disable this Mod.\n",
