  "long_description": "**EZ Voxel Builder**\n\nThis mod is designed to make placing, removing, copying and pasting Nodes (Blocks) easy. Simple commands are used to expedite the creation process. Once enabled, the mod works as follows:\n\n- Bring up the command terminal (`/` key by default)\n- Type 'b' for Build or 'c' for Copy followed by 3 parameters (ie. `/b 10 10 6`)\n- The parameters are 'Nodes Forward' 'Nodes Right' 'Nodes Up'\n- Note that parameter directions are based on the direction facing, not a specific direction like 'North'\n- The first position starts with the node immediately in front of the player\n- Using `/b 10 10 6` will build a structure 10 nodes forward by 10 nodes to the right by 6 nodes tall\n- Note that the structure built will be of the node currently being wielded by the player\n- If not wielding anything, the 'structure' built will be of \"air\", effectively deleting an area of nodes\n- Using `/c 10 -10 6` will copy 10 nodes forward by 10 nodes to the left by 6 nodes tall\n- A negative number for parameter 2 will cause nodes to be built to the left instead of to the right\n- A negative number for parameter 3 will cause nodes to be built below instead of above\n- Once an area has been copied, the player can type `/p` to paste the identical area in a new location and rotation\n- If desired, type `/pm` to paste the copied area as a mirror image of the original\n- Type `/u` to undo the previous build or paste action\n- Type `/help` for more information",
