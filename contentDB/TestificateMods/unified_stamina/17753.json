You will get the same functions no matter which sprint mod is used.\n\n## How to use\n\n```lua\n-- true if a compatible sprint mod has been found\nlocal is_active = unified_stamina.active\n\n-- get current stamina value of a given player\n-- return float between 0 and 1\n-- always return 1 if no mod with a stamina bar is present\nlocal stamina_value = unified_stamina.get(player_name)\n\n-- sets the current stamina value of a given player\n-- expects normalized value between 0 and 1 (here: 0.4 = 40% of the bar)\nlocal new_value = 0.4\nunified_stamina.set(player_name, new_value)\n\n-- changes the current stamina value of a given player by the specified amount\n-- expects normalized value between 0 and 1\n-- positive values will increase stamina, negative values will decrease it (here: decrease by 20%)\nlocal change = -0.2\nunified_stamina.add(player_name, change)\n\n-- returns the scale of the stamina bar for display purposes\n-- a return value of e.g. 20 means that a player has a total value of 20 points at 100%\nlocal display_scale = unified_stamina.get_scale()\n```\n\n## Compatible Mods\n\n* [Hbsprint](https://content.minetest.net/packages/texmex/hbsprint/) [hbsprint]\n* [Minetest Wadsprint](https://content.minetest.net/packages/drkwv/minetest_wadsprint/) [minetest_wadsprint]\n* [Sprint Lite](https://content.minetest.net/packages/mt-mods/sprint_lite/) [sprint_lite]\n* [Stamina++](https://content.minetest.net/packages/nekobit/real_stamina/) [real_stamina]\n\nThis mod doesn't work for *Stamina* by sofar or *Stamina (Fork)* by TenPlus1. Despite the name they only add a hunger bar and not an actual stamina bar. Unified Stamina API will always return full stamina if no compatible mod is installed.\n\n## License\nAll code is licensed under MIT.
