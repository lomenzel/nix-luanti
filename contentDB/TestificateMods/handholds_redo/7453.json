  "long_description": "# Handholds Redo\nMountaineering made easy\n\nThis mod is inspired by the [handholds](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=17069) mod that adds a climbing pick for easier mountaineering.\nIn that mod you can use a specialized tool to carve handholds into stone, sandstone, and ice blocks. These handholds would then allow you to climb upwards.\n\n## Noticeable Differences\nThe code has been completely rewritten from scratch in order to make some significant changes.\n\n* Instead of adding a new tool, handholds_redo lets you use your normal pickaxes by right-clicking\n* Handholds can now be carved into a lot more materials including nodes from various different mods and subgames\n* Handholds can now be carved into multiple sides of the same node\n* Mod authors can now mark nodes as carveable more easily\n* Mod authors can now assign a climbing pick ability to custom tools\n* On a technical note, handhold nodes are now wallmounted and attached, meaning they don't need to be synced with their neighbouring nodes anymore\n\n## Mod Support\n### Supported Subgames\n* Minetest Game\n* MineClone 2\n* Realtest MT5\n\n### Supported Pickaxes from other mods\n* moreores\n* mobs_monster\n* lavastuff\n* obsidianstuff\n\n### Supported Nodes from other mods\n* moreores\n* technic\n* bakedclay\n* caverealms\n* df_caverns\n* pedology\n* gloopblocks\n\n## Modding Capabilities\n__Adding a carveable node__:\nAdding additional nodes to the list of carveable materials is extremely easy.\nAll you need to do is assign a group value called ``handholds`` to the respective node like so:\n\n```lua\nminetest.register_node(\"mymod:test_node\", {\n\tdescription = \"Test Node\",\n\ttiles = { \"mymod_testnode.png\" },\n\tgroups = { handholds = 2 },\n})\n```\n\nIf you want to assign a group value to an already registered node you can either override that node\nusing ``minetest.override_item(node_name, node_definition)`` or a helper utility provided by this mod: ``handholds.mark_climbable(node_name, level)``.\nThis function will apply the specified *level* to the *handholds group* and assign it to the given node.\nA pickaxe needs to have at least the same level in order to carve the material.\nIf left unspecified, this value defaults to 1.\nFor reference: A wooden pickaxe has a value of 1, stone a value of 2, bronze and steel a value of 3, mese and diamond a value of 4.\n\n__Adding a custom pickaxe__: In order to apply the climbing behaviour to a custom pickaxe you will need to tell this mod about it. Register it as a tool like normal and then call ``handholds.register_pick(name, level)``. This function will then override the tool's right-click handler in order to assign the new behaviour. The specified *level* determines which nodes can be carved. If left unspecified, this value defaults to 1.\n\n\n# License Information\nThe source code is licensed under [GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/t-affeldt/handholds_redo/blob/master/LICENSE.md).
