  "long_description": "# Player Physics API with Monoid Support\nThis is a patched version of the original [playerphysics](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Wuzzy/playerphysics/) mod.\nUnlike the original, it is fully compatible with the [player_monoids](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Byakuren/player_monoids/) mod.\n\nBoth APIs act as compatibility layers for other mods to safely interact with physics while avoiding conflict.\nBy using this patched version, you can now use mods for both APIs in the same world.\n\n## License\nThis mod is free software, released under the MIT License.\n\nCredit goes to Wuzzy for making this mod. I only patched it to work with player_monoids.\n",
