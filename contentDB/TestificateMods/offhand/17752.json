When using a tool, press right-click to use the action of your offhand.\nThis lets you place torches and other nodes without having to put away your sword or pickaxe.\n\n## Recommended Mods\nThis mod should work with any game and configuration. However, the following mods are recommended to make the most out of it:\n\n* [visible_wielditem](https://content.minetest.net/packages/LMD/visible_wielditem/) - Attaches a 3D preview of the held item in your main hand. Recommended for visual consistency. Disable the *wieldview* mod if you also use 3d_armors.\n* [wielded_light](https://content.minetest.net/packages/bell07/wielded_light/) - Registers held items as light sources. Also works for items in your offhand. You might also be interested in the [3d_armor_light](https://content.minetest.net/packages/AntumDeluge/3d_armor_light/) extension.\n\n## Credit & License\nThis mod is licensed under GNU GPL v3 like the original.\nCheck [Mineclone 2's Credit section](https://github.com/MineClone2/MineClone2/blob/master/CREDITS.md) for information on the original authors.\n\nThe `wielditem.lua` is forked from [visible_wielditem](https://content.minetest.net/packages/LMD/visible_wielditem/) by appgurueu.
