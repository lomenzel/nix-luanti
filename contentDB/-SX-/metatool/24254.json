Most functionality is carefully selected to only contain utilities that regular player could also execute manually without using tools.\n\n- To copy/read node data: special + use.\n- For info function / special functions: sneak + use (if node does not have info then copy is executed instead).\n- For paste/write node data: use.\n\nSharetool is special administration / node sharing tool that can change node owner and set ownership to special shared account. Use command `/metatool:give metatool:sharetool` to get tool, `ban` privilege required by default.\n\n- To claim ownership: special + use.\n- For info function / special functions: sneak + use\n- To restore ownership: use.\n\nTools can be used in machines, most notably in node breakers. To allow anyone do this \"machine_use_priv\" can be set to \"interact\", default required privilege is \"server\".\n\n### Included tools:\n\n**Tubetool**\n\n* Pipeworks injectors\n* Pipeworks teleport

/ posters.\n\n**Magic Pen**\n\n* Copy / paste text between many nodes\n* Too long list, see optional dependencies.\n* Also generic support for some unlisted mods.\n\n**Tron Wrench**\n\n* Copy / paste digtron component configurations.\n\n**Container Tool**\n\n* Copy / paste container configuration.\n* Install technic machine upgrades.\n* Pipeworks receiver split stack support.\n* Complete support for technic chests.\n* Might give generic field cloning support for some unlisted mods.\n\n**Sharetool**\n\n* Homedecor books\n* Travelnet elevators\n* Travelnet travelnets\n* Mapserver POI and
