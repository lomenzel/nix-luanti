  "long_description": "This mod automatically restarts a server after a given amount of uptime is reached with an optional delay/grace period if players are online.\n\nLong running Minetest servers accumulate large memory usage over time and may exhibit various performance issues. This is most noticeable on servers running on low-end hardware (or even VPSes). This mod aims to alleviate these issues by regularly restarting the server to keep it running fresh, while giving players a heads-up that the server will be restarting.\n\n**NOTE**: This mod will simply request a server shutdown, your server setup will need to be able to start the server back up again e.g. in the form of a looping Bash script. See [Setting up a server](https://wiki.minetest.net/Setting_up_a_server#Running_the_Server) on the Minetest Wiki for an example of how to do so.\n\nBy default the mod will restart after 24 hours of uptime, with a grace period of 10 minutes if players are online. These values are configurable with `autorestart_interval` and `autorestart_delay`.\n\nIf `autorestart_delay` is 0 then it will immediately restart once the uptime is reached, otherwise it will give a certain grace period to players still online. If the server has no players at the time a restart is triggered, or if all players leave before the grace period is over it will immediately restart.\n",
