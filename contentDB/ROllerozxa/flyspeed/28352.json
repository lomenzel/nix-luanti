  "long_description": "This mod enables fine grained control over your flight speed. Useful for changing your speeds when flying around beyond the built-in fast mode toggle.\n\nPassing the `/flyspeed` command a decimal number multiplies the current flight speed (e.g. `1.5` means 150%, `2` means 200%). It will save this value between multiple joins and is saved per-player.\n\n### Known issues\nThe mod tries to detect if you're flying and only applies the speed if you are flying. As the client can't trustworthily report if it is in a (legal) flying mode it works about as well as a fly anti-cheat. ",
