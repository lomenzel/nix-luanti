  "long_description": "Per-IP interact privilege bans. When you don't want to permanently ban griefers but rather rip their arms off, and have it be enforced for all potentially new accounts under that IP.\n\nUse `/interactban` to ban an IP, if the player is online you can specify their username and their IP will be interact-banned right away. To unban an IP, use `/interactunban` (does not work with players (yet)).\n\nTo bulk-ban a list of IP addresses, put a list of them in `interactban.txt` at the world path and use `/ib_bulk` to process it.\n",
