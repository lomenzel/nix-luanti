  "long_description": "Brickbuild is a basic studded brick building game for Minetest, and the spiritual successor to [OpenBlox](https://github.com/rollerozxa/OpenBlox). It has 44 different part colours that all come in different shapes and sizes, along with other miscellaneous parts.\n\nTo build in the world, you need to enable creative mode. Disabling creative mode puts the world in a \"look, but not touch\" type of state.\n\nIn the `singlenode` mapgen, a \"baseplate\" of limited size is generated for you to begin building on. The width, depth and part colour can be changed with settings.\n\nCompared to other Minetest games, in Brickbuild your player size is significantly larger (approximately 2x), making nodes (parts) look small relative to the player's size. This allows for greater detail within the node grid.\n\nThe [WorldEdit](https://content.minetest.net/packages/sfan5/worldedit/) mod is recommended in order to easier build, but is not included with the game.",
