  "long_description": "Adds a chat command that allows you to adjust the saturation of the graphics.\n\nTo use, type `/saturation` in the chat. A slider will show up on the screen allowing you to adjust the saturation, with a scale between 0.0-2.0.\n\nCurrently saturation effects require Tonemapping (`tone_mapping`) to be enabled! This is a limitation of the engine and might not be necessary in a future update however.",
