  "long_description": "Explore a world where light is sparse and darkness consumes the poor souls who are trapped within it. Scavenge the surface for lootblocks and fight with monsters... or stay inside a little bunker messing with the stock market and the government.\n<br>\n---\nThe goal of this project is to create a game with a small file size but a good amount of features.\n\nImplemented\n---\n\n#### Controls\n**AUX1** is reserved for offhanding, you can only offhand lanterns.\n##### Spells\n**LMB** to shoot the spell<br>\n**RMB** to cast the spell on yourself\n\n#### Basics\nDying will cost you $500 and take one of your lives away.
