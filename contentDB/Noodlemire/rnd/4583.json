When active, you can use a specific amount of an item for research. Once an item is fully researched, it is permanently unlocked in the duplication menu, letting you create an infinite amount of that item.\n\nYou can choose how to fill out your duplication menu and only see types of items you actually use, but more importantly, you have to play the game in a somewhat normal fasion in order to unlock duplication. There'll be a lot less grinding, but rare materials will still be rare and difficult to research. The overall goal is to create gameplay where you can create impressive builds with relative ease, but there's still a big reason to interact with the game's other features, like exploring and fighting. In turn, those goals may naturally lead to situations where you wish to make a practical super-contraption with whichever dupes you've unlocked so far.\n\nAs long as sfinv is active, \"Research\" and \"Duplicate\" tabs will appear in your survival inventory. Otherwise, those menus can be shown using the /research and /duplicate commands, respectively.","maintainers":["Noodlemire"],"media_license":"LGPL-2.1-only","name":"rnd","provides":["rnd"],"release":4583,"repo":"https://github.com/Noodlemire/rnd.git","score":464.5,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/TOrfJ1Sltc.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/q2AupruJ03.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/RsfjTOUoQX.png"],"short_description":"Obtain and research enough of a specific item to unlock the ability to infinitely duplicate it.","state":"APPROVED","tags":["building_mechanics","inventory","survival"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/TOrfJ1Sltc.png","title":"Research N' Duplicate","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/Noodlemire/rnd/releases/4583/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"Noodlemire/rnd":[]},"hash":"13jw5wv4jhscbzlkqa1lh2n812cr8j3rwlxjnj9wg9i82krrhhyl"}
