  "long_description": "# mcl_rocky_tools\n\n- License: BSD 3-clause\n- Image license: CC-by-4.0\n- Depends: mcl_tools, mcl_farming, mcl_deepslate\n- Version: 1.0\n\nA few extra recipes for creating tools from alternate rock types:\nGranite, Andesite, Diorite, and Deepslate. The goal is to make finding\nthem a bit more exciting, although YMMV depending on which kinds of\npickaxes you like to mine with. The resulting tools are better than base\ncobblestone variants, but not as good as iron, and of course, they aren't\nmore powerful than cobblestone in terms of what they can mine. Relative\nto base cobblestone tools, these tools have the following differences:\n\n- Andesite: slightly higher durability; slightly longer reach\n- Diorite: slightly higher durability; slightly faster swing\n- Granite: somewhat higher durability\n- Deepslate: much higher durability; slightly faster swing\n# Credits\n\n- I started this by cloning [the mcl_multitool mod by\n  DUCKGO](https://codeberg.org/duckgo/mcl_multitool/src/branch/main).\n  I've rewritten the code, but leaned on the original as my example to\n  work from.\n- Textures are re-colored from the Mineclone 2 defaults, which are from\n  [the Pixel Perfection texture pack by\n  XSSheep](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/131pixel-perfection/)\n  which is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike\n  4.0 International\n  License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
