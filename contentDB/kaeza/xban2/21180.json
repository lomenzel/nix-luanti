  "long_description": "This mod attempts to be an improvement to Minetest's ban system.\n\n* It supports normal bans and temporary bans (from 60 seconds up to the end of\n  time, with 1 second granularity).\n* Records and joins all accounts using the same IP address and several IP\n  addresses using the same name into a single record, and can ban/unban them as\n  a single user.\n* Can ban offline players if you know their IP or username.\n* Holds a record of bans for each user, so moderators and administrators can\n  consult it to know if a player is a repeat offender.\n* Does not modify the default ban database in any way (`ipban.txt').\n* Has an API to ban and check the ban database to allows other mods to manage\n  users (for example, anticheat mods).\n\n## Chat commands\n\nThe mod provides the following chat commands. All commands require the `ban`\nprivilege.\n\n### `xban`\n\nBans a player permanently.\n\n**Usage:** `/xban <player_or_ip> <reason>`\n\n**Example:** `/xban 127.0.0.1 Some reason.`\n\n### `xtempban`\n\nBans a player temporarily.\n\n**Usage:** `/xtempban <player_or_ip> <time> <reason>`\n\nThe `time` parameter is a string in the format `<count><unit>` where `<unit>`\nis one of `s` for seconds, `m` for minutes, `h` for hours, `D` for days, `W`\nfor weeks, `M` for months, or `Y` for years. If the unit is omitted, it is\nassumed to mean seconds. For example, `42s` means 42 seconds, `1337m` 1337\nminutes, and so on. You can chain more than one such group and they will add\nup. For example, `1Y3M3D7h` will ban for 1 year, 3 months, 3 days and 7 hours.\n\n**Example:** `/xtempban Joe 3d Some reason.`\n\n### `xunban`\n\nUnbans a player.\n\n**Usage:** `/xunban <player_or_ip>`\n\n**Example:** `/xunban Joe`\n\n### `xban_record`\n\nShows the ban record on chat.\n\n**Usage:** `/xban_record <player_or_ip>`\n\nThis prints one ban entry per line, with the time the ban came into effect,\nthe expiration time (if applicable), the reason, and the source of the ban.\nThe record is printed to chat with one entry per line.\n\n**Example:** `/xban_record Joe`\n\n### `xban_wl`\n\nManages the whitelist.\n\n**Usage:** `/xban_wl (add|del|get) <player_or_ip>`\n\nWhitelisted players are allowed on the server even if it's otherwise marked\nas banned. This is useful to only allow certain users from shared computers,\nfor example.\n\nThe `add` subcommand adds the player to the whitelist. The `del` subcommand\nremoves the player from the whitelist. The `get` subcommand checks if the\nplayer is in the whitelist, and prints the status to chat.\n\n**Example:** `/xban_record add Jane`\n\n### `xban_gui`\n\nShows a form to consult the database interactively.\n\n**Usage:** `/xban_gui`\n\n## Administrator commands\n\nThe following commands require the `server` privilege, so they are only\navailable to server administrators.\n\n### `xban_dbi`\n\nImports ban entries from other database formats.\n\n**Usage:** `/xban_dbi <importer>`\n\nThe `importer` argument specifies from which database to import. These are\nthe supported import plugins at the time of writing:\n\n* `minetest`: Import entries from Minetest's ban list (`ipban.txt`).\n* `v1`: Old format used by xban (`players.iplist`).\n* `v2`: Old format used by xban (`players.iplist.v2`).\n\n**Example:** `/xban_dbi minetest`\n\n### `xban_cleanup`\n\nRemoves all non-banned entries from the xban db.\n\n**Usage:** `/xban_cleanup`\n",
