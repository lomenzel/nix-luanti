(heavily modified)  \nUses fireworks from new_fireworks mod.  \nUses center print from central_message mod.  \nUses mob support from mobkit and mob_core mods.  \n  \nChat with us? https://discord.gg/kj86Y5ZXXg  \n  \n### What's new:  \n - New labratory building that can be chained up for limitless creativity. (Requires defeating all 3 dragons first)\n - Most buildings can now be activated by signals.\n - An exciting new challenge from The Royal Blob, who is hidden well within the depths of the game.\n - More reliable handling of events, such as jumping.",
