The contents of this file will display as the news. When changing the contents of the file, there is no need to restart the server for it to update in game.\n\nPlayers can also type /news to display the formspec at any time.\n\nPlayers with the news_bypass privilege will not see the formspec when they sign in, but can still use the /news command.",
