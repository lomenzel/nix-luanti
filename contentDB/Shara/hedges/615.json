  "long_description": "This mod adds hedges that automatically connect to each other when placed and that can be crafted from leaves. Hedges connect both horizontally and vertically, making it possible to build hedge mazes a player cannot jump over.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Hedges automatically adjust height so there are no gaps when building tall hedges.\n- If MTG is used, hedges for all types of tree in MTG are automatically registered.\n- Additional recipes have been added for MTG bush leaves.\n- An API is provided so that other mods that add trees can register their own hedges.\n",
