  "long_description": "Mezzee-what?\n------------\n[Mesecons](http://mesecons.net/)! They're yellow, they're conductive, and they'll add a whole new dimension to Minetest's gameplay.\n\nMesecons is a mod for [Minetest](http://minetest.net/) that implements a ton of items related to digital circuitry, such as wires, buttons, lights, and even programmable controllers. Among other things, there are also pistons, solar panels, pressure plates, and note blocks.\n\nMesecons has a similar goal to Redstone in Minecraft, but works in its own way, with different rules and mechanics.\n\nHow do I use this thing?\n------------------------\nHow about a [quick overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kmeQj6iW5k)?\n\nOr maybe a [comprehensive reference](http://mesecons.net/items.html) is your style?\n\nAn overview for the very newest of new beginners? How does [this one](http://uberi.mesecons.net/projects/MeseconsBasics/index.html) look?\n\nWant to get more into building? Why not check out the [Mesecons Laboratory](http://uberi.mesecons.net/), a website dedicated to advanced Mesecons builders?\n\nWant to contribute to Mesecons itself?
