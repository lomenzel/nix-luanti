Change these coords if you want to change them\n\n2) `position_text_HUD_mail`: This is the coords of the text of the mail alert said before. Change these coords if you want to change them\n\n3) `permission_to_remove_mailman`: This is the permission that the player need to have if want to remove the mailman. If the user that punch the mail man (left button mouse) has this permission can decrease the HP of the mailman and so remove the entity. If the user doesn't have this permission the mailman HP won't decrease.\n\nAnother thing, if the player has this permission could change the angle of the entity, just keep press the `sneak button` (usually left shift) and punch the mail main with the left button of mouse, and the mailman will rotate.\n\nAfter these config, you only need to spawn the \"mailman\" entity inside your world with this command in the chat:\n`/spawn_mailman`, this command will spawn your Postman at the exactly coords where you are when you type that command.\n\nAfter that, you need simply right-click on this entity and will open your Inbox and then you are ready to write and read your mails:)\n\nAre you far away from the postman and you need to open your inbox? Don't worry, simply type in the chat the command `/mailbox` and your inbox will be opened!\n\n### Want to help?\nFeel free to:\n* open an [issue](https://gitlab.com/mrfreeman_works/minetest_mails/-/issues)\n* submit a merge request. In this case, PLEASE, do follow milestones and my [coding guidelines](https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/view/-l75iHl3x54py20u2Y5OSAX4iruQBdeQXcO7PGTtGew/embed/).
