Note that this is not a replacement for the built-in anti-cheat, but rather an addition to it. This is intended for simple mini-game servers rather than heavily modded survival servers. You will likely need to disable some checks based on your needs.\n\nPlayers with the `nebula_anticheat_alert` privilege can see anti-cheat alerts. Note that this isn't needed, since punishment is automatic.\n","maintainers":["JoinNebula"],"media_license":"CC0-1.0","name":"nebula_anticheat","provides":["nebula_anticheat"],"release":29480,"repo":"https://gitgud.io/JoinNebula/nebula_anticheat","score":2.9,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/1fee85bec2.png"],"short_description":"Cheat detection and prevention","state":"APPROVED","tags":["multiplayer","server_tools"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/1fee85bec2.png","title":"Nebula Anti-Cheat","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/JoinNebula/nebula_anticheat/releases/29480/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"JoinNebula/nebula_anticheat":[]},"hash":"1ypw6gzvdmcbs32ak5gm8jak650ngcg23wqcbzmpwzlhkwjc8snc"}
