The mods below can be used for sprint detection:\n\n[Stamina](https://content.luanti.org/packages/sofar/stamina/)  \n[Stamina (Fork)](https://content.luanti.org/packages/TenPlus1/stamina/)  \n[Hbsprint](https://content.luanti.org/packages/texmex/hbsprint/) with [Player Monoids](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Byakuren/player_monoids/)  \n[Wadsprint](https://content.luanti.org/packages/drkwv/minetest_wadsprint/)  \n[Stamina++](https://content.luanti.org/packages/swagtoy/real_stamina/)  \n[Sprint Lite](https://content.luanti.org/packages/mt-mods/sprint_lite/)\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Physics multipliers may not be reliable unless one of the mods below are used. The recommended setup is to use both [Player Monoids](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Byakuren/player_monoids/) and [Player Physics API with Monoid Support](https://content.luanti.org/packages/TestificateMods/playerphysics/). The reason is that some mods, like Stamina, do not work with a speed or gravity multiplier without Player Monoids, but Player Monoids does not support changing air acceleration, while Player Physics API does.\n\n[Player Monoids](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Byakuren/player_monoids/)\\*  \n[Player Physics API](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Wuzzy/playerphysics/)  \n[Player Physics API with Monoid Support](https://content.luanti.org/packages/TestificateMods/playerphysics/)\n\n**INCOMPATIBLE:** Despite using [Pova](https://content.luanti.org/packages/TenPlus1/pova/)*'s API when available, multipliers don't work at all with support enabled, and gravity and speed don't work with support disabled\n\n\\* Items marked with a star require a config change due to not supporting a change in air acceleration (not needed if you use Player Physics API)\n\n## Developer API\n\n```lua\nnebula_combat.register_on_knockback(function(player, hitter, time_from_last_punch, tool_capabilities, dir, distance, damage)\n    -- Values that are not provided, like the vertical values in this example, will be the default from the config (or what another mod gives)\n    return {\n        horizontal_momentum = 0.0,\n        horizontal_force = 15.0,\n        physics_duration = 3.0 -- How long (in seconds) to apply physics multipliers like speed, gravity, and air accel\n        gravity_mult = 0.2\n    }\nend)\n```\n\n```lua\n-- This API exists so sprint mods can add support if it isn't built-in\n-- This API does not affect the player in any way, it simply marks them as sprinting for our detections\n-- The id should be your mod id\nnebula_combat.set_sprinting(player, sprinting, id)\n```\n\n```lua\nnebula_combat.is_sprinting(player)\n```\n","maintainers":["JoinNebula"],"media_license":"CC0-1.0","name":"nebula_combat","provides":["nebula_combat"],"release":28388,"repo":"https://gitgud.io/JoinNebula/nebula_combat","score":2.2,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/8e73a1d07e.png"],"short_description":"A combat customizer for competitive servers: customize knockback, attack interval, attack distance, damage multiplier, etc.","state":"APPROVED","tags":["multiplayer","pvp"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/8e73a1d07e.png","title":"Nebula Combat","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/JoinNebula/nebula_combat/releases/28388/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"JoinNebula/nebula_combat":[]},"hash":"016v4nzdn0bqpqv3fvgwcy6hmkisxhcjw455kd08s4in34yg7lsm"}
