You can choose to play in a “survival mode” in which you have to\nfight monsters and hunger for survival and slowly progress through the various\nother aspects of the game, such as mining, farming, building machines, and so on\nOr you can play in “creative mode” in which you can build almost anything\ninstantly.\n\n#### Gameplay summary\n* Sandbox-style gameplay, no goals\n* Survive: Fight against hostile monsters and hunger\n* Mine for ores and other treasures\n* Magic: Gain experience and enchant your tools\n* Use the collected blocks to create great buildings, your imagination is the\n  limit\n* Collect flowers (and other dye sources) and colorize your world\n* Find some seeds and start farming\n* Find or craft one of hundreds of items\n* Build a railway system and have fun with minecarts\n* Build complex machines with redstone circuits\n* In creative mode you can build almost anything for free and without limits\n\n## How to play (quick start)\n### Getting started\n* **Punch a tree** trunk until it breaks and collect wood\n* Place the **wood into the 2×2 grid** (your “crafting grid” in your inventory\n  menu) and craft 4 wood planks\n* Place the 4 wood planks in a 2×2 shape in the crafting grid to **make a\n  crafting table**\n* **Rightclick the crafting table** for a 3×3 crafting grid to craft more\n  complex things\n* Use the **crafting guide** (book icon) to learn all the possible crafting\n  recipes\n* **Craft a wooden pickaxe** so you can dig stone\n* Different tools break different kinds of blocks.

You can access the help from your inventory menu.\n\n### Special items\nThe following items are interesting for Creative Mode and for adventure\nmap builders. They can not be obtained in-game or in the creative inventory.\n\n* Barrier: `vlf_core:barrier`\n\nUse the `/giveme` chat command to obtain them. See the in-game help for\nan explanation.\n\n## Installation\nThis game requires [Minetest](http://minetest.net) to run (version 5.5.1 or\nlater). So you need to install Minetest first. Only stable versions of Minetest\nare officially supported. There is no support for running VoxelForge in\ndevelopment versions of Minetest. If you have issues in dev versions, \nthen we will attempt to reproduce them in stable versions, \nand if we can't then the issue will be closed, \nand it will be looked into at the next release.\n\nTo install VoxelForge (if you haven't already), move this directory into the\n“games” directory of your Minetest data directory. Consult the help of\nMinetest to learn more.\n\n## Useful links\nThe VoxelForge repository is hosted at [Github](https://github.com).\nTo contribute or report issues, head there.\n\n* Github: <https://github.com/VoxelForge/VoxelForge>\n* Discord: <https://discord.gg/7Jv5s7dnzG>\n\n## Project description\nThe main goal of **VoxelForge** is to be a very close but stable and performant \nMinecraft clone. released as free software.\n\n* We try to clone Minecraft as well as Minetest currently permits without\n  resorting to hacks which are too heavyweight or complicated to maintain\n* Cloning the gameplay has highest priority.\n* VoxelForge will use different graphics and sounds, but with a similar style\n\n## Completion status\nThis game is currently in **Beta** stage.\nIt is
