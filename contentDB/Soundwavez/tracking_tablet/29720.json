(just scale it to a number that fits your screen.) (you will know its at the right scale when the info bars at the top of the device are aligned with the black behind them.\"as shown above in the instructional screenshot.\")\n\n(0.425) works pretty good for my laptop screen, (0.75) seems to work pretty good for my bigger monitor screen.\n\n--this mod should suppport most games you try to combine it with. (mineclone works surprisingly well!)",
