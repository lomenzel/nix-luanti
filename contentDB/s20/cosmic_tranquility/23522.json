The colour scheme for the key textures is based on the [Mocha Catppuccin Pallete](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin#-palette).\n\n## TODO\n\n- Other tools\n- Check if the gun textures need modification. If not, leave as it is.\n- Check how player textures work.\n- Find the overall \"cosmic theme\"\n- GUI changes\n- Block textures\n",
