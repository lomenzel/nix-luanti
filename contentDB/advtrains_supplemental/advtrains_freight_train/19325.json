  "long_description": "# AdvTrains Freight Train Pack\n\nThis freight train pack adds 4 more types of freight wagons to the\ngame as well as a slower diesel locomotive. All of the wagons and the locomotive\nare recoverable - they drop themselves instead of steel. The recoverability and\nslow speed of the locomotive have earned it the nickname of \"shunter\".\n\nThe wagons types included are:\n\n* Track wagon\n* Lava wagon\n* Gravel wagon\n* Tree wagon\n\nThe wagons also have a higher capacity of 48 compared to the standard 24\ninventory slots. However, their speed limit is also slower, being only 10 m/s\n(36 km/h).\n\n[View this mod at the Train Catalogue](https://advtrains.de/wiki/doku.php?id=usage:trains:advtrains_freight_train:start)\n\n## License\n\n* Original code and assets copyright (C) 2017 MBB\n    * models/*\n    * textures/advtrains\\_wagon\\_*\n    * textures/advtrains\\_engine\\_diesel.b3d\n* Portions of code (C) 2018, 2020 Smacker\n* Art assets by Smacker:\n    * sounds/advtrains\\_engine\\_diesel\\_horn.ogg\n    * textures/advtrains\\_engine\\_diesel\\_inv.png\n* Portions of code (C) 2023 Blockhead\n* textures/advtrains\\_engine\\_diesel\\_livery modified by gpcf 2020, again by\nBlockhead 2023\n\nThis software and its assets are licensed under the Creative Commons\nShareAlike-Attribution License 3.0 (CC BY-SA 3.0); see LICENSE.txt for details.\n\n## Credits\n\n* Original Author: MBB\n* Contributions by: Blockhead\n* Diesel locomotive inventory image, Horn sound: Added by Smacker\n* Livery features: Added by gpcf, improved by Blockhead\n\n\nThe original art was done by mbb.
