  "long_description": "# AdvTrains Train Pack: Orient Express\n\n\nThe orient express is a set of three passenger wagons and an electric\nlocomotive, originally authored by MBB. The wagons are styled after the\npassenger rollingstock of the CIWL, operator of the Orient Express; their\nprofile is the same as the passenger wagon that ships with Basic Trains. The\nlocomotive seems inspired by the Deutsche Reichsbahn class E42/142/242 in a\ngreen livery, which has pulled Orient Express trains before, though in a\ndifferent livery. The mod's full name is advtrains\\_train\\_orient\\_express.\n\nThis train is currently developed by W3RQ01 as part of the AdvTrains\nSupplemental organisation. W3RQ01 added engine and horn sounds, fixed the\ninventory images, fixed the drops and reworked the textures. He also added the\n'restored' wagon.\n\n[View this mod at the Train\nCatalogue](https://advtrains.de/wiki/doku.php?id=usage:trains:advtrains_train_orient_express)\n\n## License\n\n* Original code and assets copyright (C) 2017 MBB\n    * textures/advtrains\\_compartment\\_inv.png\n    * textures/advtrains\\_compartment.png\n    * textures/advtrains\\_engine\\_electronic.png\n    * textures/advtrains\\_sleep.png\n    * models/advtrains\\_engine\\_electronic.b3d\n    * models/advtrains\\_wagon\\_compartment.b3d\n    * models/advtrains\\_wagon\\_sleep.b3d\n* Portions of code and some textures and sounds (C) 2022 W3RQ01\n    * textures/advtrains\\_compartment\\_inv.png\n    * textures/advtrains\\_compartment.png (partially derived from MBB's work)\n    * textures/advtrains\\_sleep\\_inv.png\n    * textures/advtrains\\_engine\\_electronic\\_2.png (partially derived from\n        MBB's work)\n    * textures/advtrains\\_engine\\_electronic\\_inv.png\n    * textures/advtrains\\_orient\\_express\\_restored\\_inv.png\n    * textures/advtrains\\_orient\\_express\\_restored.png (partially derived from\n        MBB's work)\n    * textures/advtrains\\_sleep\\_inv.png\n    * textures/advtrains\\_sleep.png (partially derived from MBB's work)\n    * sounds/advtrains\\_train\\_orient\\_express\\_engine\\_throttle.ogg\n* Portions of code (C) 2022 Blockhead\n* Horn sound originally from Basic Trains/Advtrains Trains Industrial by MBB\n* 'Electronic engine' sound recorded by W3RQ01\n\nThis software and its assets are licensed under the Creative Commons\nShareAlike-Attribution License 3.0 (CC BY-SA 3.0); see LICENSE.txt for details.\n\n## Credits\n\n* Original Author: MBB\n* Contributions by: Blockhead\n* Contributions by: W3RQ01\n    * Fixed drops\n    * Added sounds\n    * Fixed speed limits\n    * Added new wagon\n    * Reworked textures\n    * Created readme     \n",
