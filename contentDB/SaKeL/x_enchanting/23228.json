  "long_description": "Adds Enchanting Mechanics and API.\n\n## Features\n\n* does not add new tools/items, it's using MT API to change existing items instead\n* adds enchanting table\n* supports all registered tools with known tool groups: pickaxe, shovel, axe, sword, e.g. `groups = {pickaxe = 1}`\n* supports `default:bookshelf` or anything with `group:bookshelf`\n* supports all bows with group `{bow = 1}`\n* enchanting trade is for `default:mese_crystal` or anything with `groups = {enchanting_trade = 1}`\n* adds enchantability for all MT default tools, for custom tools the enchantability can be set in the item group, e.g. `groups = {enchantability = 15}`\n* uses only MT engine mechanics (e.g. tool capabilities)\n* enchanted items have detailed enchantments description/short description\n* mesh node model\n* mesh entity model and animations\n* tool texture will have enchanted glint\n* adds grind stone to remove enchantments (excluding curses)\n\n## How To\n\n### Enchanting Setup\n\nFor maximum level of enchantments you need maximum of 15 bookshelfs around the enchanting table, maximum of 2 blocks away. Maximum level is 30.\n\n### Enchanting Table\n\nTo be able to enchant items you need a trade item (by default `default:mese_crystal` or anything with `groups = {enchanting_trade = 1}`). Higher level enchantments costs more: level 1,2,3 costs mese crystals 1,2,3.\nWhen place item in the enchantment table item slot you can see three buttons with:\n- left side the trade cost amount\n- middle the enchantment you will get + maybe more enchantments\n- right side the base level for the enchantment (depends on how many bookshelfs are in reach)\nWhen you place item in the enchantment table trade slot you will see that some buttons are now enabled and can be clicked on - depends on trade amount available.\nThe enchantments shown in the enchantment table will be always the same for item - this will change after you enchant an item. After enchanting an item a new enchantments will be shown.\n\n### Item Enchantability\n\nAll default tools have enchantability set. Higher enchantability = higher chance of getting better enchantments.\nItems enchantibility from worst to best:\n- stone\n- diamond\n- steel\n- wood / mese\n- bronze\n\n### Every Enchantment Explained\n\n#### Sharpness\n\nIncreases melee damage.\n\ngroups: sword\n\n#### Fortune\n\nIncreases the number and/or chances of specific item drops. Works with groups: stone, soil, sand, snowy, slippery, tree, leaves and all registered ores.\n\nIncompatible: Silk Touch\n\ngroups: pickaxe, shovel, axe\n\n#### Unbreaking\n\nIncreases the item's durability.\n\ngroups: any\n\n#### Efficiency\n\nIncreases the player's mining speed. Also adds mining groupcaps to item, e.g. enchanted wood pickaxe can mine level 1 nodes (e.g. obsidian) after enchantment.\n\ngroups: pickaxe, shovel, axe\n\n#### Silk Touch\n\nCauses certain blocks to drop themselves as items instead of their usual drops when mined. Mods can prevent this behaviour with adding group `{ no_silktouch = 1 }` to the nodes.\n\nIncompatible: Fortune\n\ngroups: pickaxe, shovel, axe\n\n#### Curse of Vanishing\n\nCauses the item to disappear on death.\n\ngroups: any\n\n#### Knockback\n\nIncreases knockback (players only).\n\ngroups: sword\n\n#### Looting\n\nCause mobs to drop more items. This value is not used in the engine; it is the responsibility of the game/mod code to implement this.\n\nSupported: mobs_monster, mobs_animal, animalia\n\ngroups: sword\n\n#### Power\n\nIncreases arrow damage.\nDamage has to be calculated in the MOD where the bow comes from!\n\ngroups: bow\n\n#### Punch\n\nIncreases arrow knockback.\nKnockback has to be calculated in the MOD where the bow comes from!\n\nThis can be obtained from tool meta:\n\ngroups: bow\n\n#### Infinity\n\nPrevents regular arrows from being consumed when shot.\nOne arrow is needed INSIDE QUIVER to use a bow enchanted with Infinity.\nFired arrows cannot be retrieved even if they are not fired from Quiver.\nOnly set in item meta, logic for this has to be in the MOD where the bow comes from!\n\ngroups: bow\n\n## API\n\n`ItemStackMetaRef`\n\n* `get_float(key)`: Returns `0` if key not present. `key` can be enchantment id prefixed with `is_`,\ne.g. enchantment `punch` would have stored meta as `is_punch`. If returned value is bigger than zero\nthen the value represents enchantment level bonus. See below fields for bow:\n    * `power` Increase percentage\n    * `punch` Multiplier\n    * `infinity` If `1` then it is infinity enchanted\n* `get_string(key)`: Returns `\"\"` if key not present. See below fields for all enchantments:\n    * `x_enchanting` Serialized table with key/value pairs where: `key` is enchantment `id` and `value` is `Enchantment` definition\n\n`Enchantment` definition\n\n* `value` number, Value of the enchantment based on level, e.g. multiplier, percentage/number increase...\n\nexample:\n\n```lua\n-- For simplicity assuming that all meta are present (biggger than zero or not \"\")\n-- MODs have to add those checks individually\n\nlocal itemstack_meta = itemstack:get_meta()\n\nlocal power_value = itemstack_meta:get_float('is_power')\nlocal punch_value = itemstack_meta:get_float('is_punch')\nlocal infinity_value = itemstack_meta:get_float('is_infinity')\n\n-- Or for list of all enchantments\nlocal x_enchanting = minetest.deserialize(itemstack_meta:get_string('x_enchanting')) or {}\nlocal power_enchantment = enchantments.power\nlocal punch_enchantment = enchantments.punch\nlocal infinity_enchantment = enchantments.infinity\n\n-- Custom logic\nlocal new_damage = damage + damage * (punch_enchantment.value / 100)\nlocal new_knockback = knockback * punch_enchantment.value\n\nif enchantments.infinity.value > 0 then\n    -- Some logic for infinity\nend\n```",
