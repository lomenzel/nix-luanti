  "long_description": "Primarily adds an API for registering spawner blocks for other mods to use.\n\n## Features\n\n- Activations area - radius 16 blocks - when player is inside this aread the spawner will activate\n- Placing torch (`group:torch`) on top of the spawner will disable the spawner\n- Spawner will not work if all adjacent sides are blocked\n- Some mobs can spawn only during night/day only (or both)\n- Some mobs can spawn in water (e.g. `group:water`) or any other defined `node` in cofiguration\n- Spawner will stop spawning if there are too many mobs of the same type in the aread (9x9x9 nodes)\n- Spawner will stop spawning if there are too many entities in MapBlock area (16x16x16 nodes)\n- Mobs will spawn around spawner randomly in 9x9x3 area - mob height (collisionbox) is being accounted\n- Spawner will not spawn in protected areas\n- Spawner can spawn up to four mobs at the same time\n- If the spawner is not spawning (in 'waiting' state) for too long, it will get rusted and will not work anymore - only digging and placing the spwaner again will activate it\n- If admin (or someone with `privs` priviledge) will place the spawner, this spawner will never rust\n- If spawner has environmental configuration it will generate spawners during mapgen\n- Environmental can be found in dungeons and caves\n- Environmental spawners are not rusting\n- Environmental will not drop spawner when dug\n- Wrote in TypeScript\n\n## Usage\n\n- right click (secondary action) on spawner with egg item - works with animalia crates and net (assuming you have animal inside)",
