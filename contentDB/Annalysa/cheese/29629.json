Having to put in the input slot a bucket of milk,\nwait for it to cook into cheese and then manually take out of the input the empty\nbucket to then replace it with yet another bucket, doing the same thing over and over????\nWell, look no further fellow minetester! I present you a way to craft cheese in a different way,\nwithout having to swap buckets ever again! ;)\n\n### Boiling\nFirst lets talk about the *Milk Cauldron*:\nUse copper to craft this furnace-like node. It can only boil some liquid held in a\nbucket, therefor you cannot use it to smelt or cook anything else.\nYou can use milk buckets, water buckets to make salt, and a few more items!\nIt has 4 distinct slots types:\n#### Input or Source\nIn order to activate the boiling, you need to add something to boil first!\n#### Input Reserve\nAs the max stack size of a bucket holding a liquid is 1, there are problems to boil\nmore than one thing, therefor this slot list can come to your aid!\nWhen an item is done boiling in the Source slot, another item will be automatically\nfetched from this Reserve, and the boiling process will continue! (if you added boilable items of course)\n#### Output or Destination\nThis is a normal slot, like in the furnace, except that you will get the replacements\nhere, so this slot will held empty buckets too!\n#### Fuel\nNormal fuel slot, nothing to add here. Enjoy boiling! ;)\n\n### Cheese Aging\nNow, did you expect cheese to come out of that cauldron? Well, nope.\nMilk boils into two things, *Curd* with is the sold part, and *Whey* which is the liquid part.\nCheese is essentially aged curd, but where to start this process? In a *Cheese Aging Rack*!\nThere are a total of 12 different cheese types that you can acquire, through the use of this Rack,\nplaced in a dark spot. There are 3 types of Cheese Rack, *Wooden*, *Stone* and *Mossy*, each with\ntheir aging time, giving you a a few pieces of one random type of the 4 assigned to that Rack.\nSo if you want a particular cheese, you need to have the right Rack.\nIf you have the mod [astral] installed, there will be differences upon harvesting the aged cheese,\nif certain moon or sun event is happening.\nYou can still normally cook *Curd* to get a \"default\" cheese (for example mobs:cheese)\nand *Whey* into *Ricotta* (You can boil it in the *Milk Cauldron* too).\n\n### Stretched Cheese\nActually... there are a few more cheeses, that you can craft instead of wait to age.\nYou can use *Curd* with water and salt to craft *Stretched Cheese*, and give it a shape,\nmaking *Mozzarella*, *Scamorza* and *Caciocavallo*. *Scamorza* can be eaten as it\nis but it satiates more if you cook it into *Smoked Scamorza*. You need some string\nto craft *Caciocavallo* and cannot be eaten as is. In needs to age by hanging it\non a wooden ceiling in the dark. I know, when i said that there is *Mozzarella*,\nyou would want a pizza, right? Not here, sorry. This mod only provides cheeses.\nTheir uses are on other mods using this one.\n\n### Maing Cream\nThere are other dairy products, you know? Like *Cream*! And what usage has the other liquid\nthat you can from boiling milk? Just craft a *Cream Separator* and you'll find out!\nRight click on it, with either milk or *Whey*, and it will spin, (technically, centrifuging)\ngiving you some delicious *Cream*! If you use milk you will get more than just by using *Whey*.\n\n### Making Butter\nYet another dairy product, *Butter*! Much like the *Cream Separator*, you need to craft a\n*Churn* and right click it to get some golden *Butter*. You can use milk to get one piece of butter,\nor *Cream* to get 3.\n\n### Ice Cream\nYes. There is *Ice Cream* too! You can craft a base using milk, *Cream*, sugar and snow.\nCurrently there isnt much to do with it except *Neapolitan Ice Cream*, but if you\nhave the [icecream] mod installed, the recipes will now use this new base.\n\n### Veg Alternatives\nWhy? Why not! I wanted to include more people, so this mod can be used by dairy-free people too!\nif you have the [moretrees] mod, you can make *Coconut Cream* with coconut milk usign the *Cream Separator*,\n*Vegetable Butter* by using the *Churn* with *Vegetable Butter Preparation*, crafted with *Coconut Cream*,\noil and vegetable milk and *Vegan Ice Cream* crafting together vegetable milk, *Coconut Cream*, sugar and snow.\n\n### Fantasy Cheeses\nYes, you read that right. There is a fourth Rack type: *Obsidian*. You can use *Curd*\nor ... other items, each giving you a specific type of cheese, so this isn't random.\nI'll let you find out how to use it, but you'll need [ethereal] mod for most cheese.\nIts behaviour changes if you again have [astral] and [mana] mod installed. There is a change to [moobloom] too.\nEating each fantasy cheese will give you a special effect if you have the [playereffects] mod installed.\n(The effects still need to be worked on, they are not perfect).\n\n### License\nCode and Textures by Annalysa, GLGP LICENSE v2.1 for code, CC-BY-SA 3.0 UNPORTED for textures.\nSounds are CC0.\n\n##### *Italian traslation available*\n","maintainers":["Annalysa"],"media_license":"CC-BY-3.0","name":"cheese","provides":["cheese"],"release":29629,"repo":"https://github.com/AnnalysaTheMinetester/cheese.git","score":492.7,"screenshots":["https://content.luanti.org/uploads/73e07fbc3c.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/8b1958bbb1.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/6550a6c72e.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/1b2f17c409.png","https://content.luanti.org/uploads/848735d1c7.png"],"short_description":"Boil milk and then let the curd age to get cheese!","state":"APPROVED","tags":["education","food","simulation"],"thumbnail":"https://content.luanti.org/thumbnails/1/73e07fbc3c.png","title":"Cheese","translation_url":null,"type":"mod","url":"https://content.luanti.org/packages/Annalysa/cheese/releases/29629/download/","video_thumbnail_url":null,"video_url":null,"website":null,"dependencies":{"Annalysa/cheese":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"bucket","packages":["Noodlemire/voxeldungeon","IcyDiamond/fluid_lib","Amaz/lordofthetest","daret/bucket","1248/castrum","Minetest/minetest_game","1248/regnum","debiankaios/proxima_survival","1248/regnum2","Casimir/voxelgarden","Luanti/devtest","Kimapr/nonsensical_skyblock","rheo/bucket","bell07/whynot_game","Big_Caballito/no_mans_land","hilol/epic_combat","TheFanne/raining_nodes","PetiAPocok/minetest_extended","mooD_Slayer/ksurvive","EmptyStar/asuna","mt-mods/dreambuilder_game","rubenwardy/capturetheflag"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"vessels","packages":["Noodlemire/voxeldungeon","sunnysideup/holidayhorrors","Amaz/lordofthetest","1248/castrum","Minetest/minetest_game","1248/regnum","1248/regnum2","miroptics/qiskitblocks_miro","Kimapr/nonsensical_skyblock","Casimir/voxelgarden","JavaFXpert/qiskitblocks","jgordon510/gridlocks","bell07/whynot_game","Big_Caballito/no_mans_land","TheFanne/raining_nodes","rlars/occupymoon_game","PetiAPocok/minetest_extended","MeseCraft/mesecraft","hilol/epic_combat","EmptyStar/asuna","rubenwardy/capturetheflag","mt-mods/dreambuilder_game"]},{"is_optional":false,"name":"default","packages":["AiTechEye/xaenvironment","Hi_World/newplanet","Noodlemire/voxeldungeon","JALdMIC/survivethedays","sunnysideup/holidayhorrors","BuckarooBanzay/mesecons_lab","nam/porko","Amaz/lordofthetest","1248/castrum","Thunder1035/etb","1248/regnum","Minetest/minetest_game","debiankaios/proxima_survival","carlos_rupp/berzerkpt","1248/regnum2","miroptics/qiskitblocks_miro","KareaGhandTrail/block_assault_mapmaker","KareaGhandTrail/block_assault","Casimir/voxelgarden","bell07/whynot_game","JavaFXpert/qiskitblocks","Kimapr/nonsensical_skyblock","jgordon510/gridlocks","giga-turbo/codecube","niwla23/runorfall","Thunder1035/pacman","Big_Caballito/no_mans_land","MeseCraft/mesecraft","hilol/epic_combat","TheFanne/raining_nodes","rlars/occupymoon_game","PetiAPocok/minetest_extended","mooD_Slayer/ksurvive","EmptyStar/asuna","mt-mods/dreambuilder_game","rubenwardy/capturetheflag"]}],"IcyDiamond/fluid_lib":[{"is_optional":false,"name":"default","packages":["AiTechEye/xaenvironment","Hi_World/newplanet","Noodlemire/voxeldungeon","JALdMIC/survivethedays","sunnysideup/holidayhorrors","BuckarooBanzay/mesecons_lab","nam/porko","Amaz/lordofthetest","1248/castrum","Thunder1035/etb","1248/regnum","Minetest/minetest_game","debiankaios/proxima_survival","carlos_rupp/berzerkpt","1248/regnum2","miroptics/qiskitblocks_miro","KareaGhandTrail/block_assault_mapmaker","KareaGhandTrail/block_assault","Casimir/voxelgarden","bell07/whynot_game","JavaFXpert/qiskitblocks","Kimapr/nonsensical_skyblock","jgordon510/gridlocks","giga-turbo/codecube","niwla23/runorfall","Thunder1035/pacman","Big_Caballito/no_mans_land","MeseCraft/mesecraft","hilol/epic_combat","TheFanne/raining_nodes","rlars/occupymoon_game","PetiAPocok/minetest_extended","mooD_Slayer/ksurvive","EmptyStar/asuna","mt-mods/dreambuilder_game","rubenwardy/capturetheflag"]}]},"hash":"145x950bzyjy1hbzva58vhhzz8csvwcf0fy8bybxf4bwavpki5al"}
