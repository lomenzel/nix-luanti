  "long_description": "Cirno's Perfect Math Library\n====\n\nThis is a Love (the game framework) library CPML which has been ported and modified to work in the context of Luanti.\n\n### Main features\n* only Luanti Library which implements the ability to manipulate matrices and quaternions and convert them reliably to irrlicht bone rotations.\n* bounding box modules\n* mat4\n* vec3\n* quaternions\n* octrees\n* bvh lib\n* more\n\n### Adapted for Luanti\nFor best memory performance: have luaJIT & it's FFI library (this should be built into luaJIT), and add LEEF-Math to your trusted list (so it can `require()` call the FFI library).\n\nVarious useful bits of game math. 3D line intersections, ray casting, 2d/3d vectors, 4x4 matrices, quaternions, etc.\n\nThis is a fork of CPML (for LÃ–VE/love3d), it's been ported over the minetest so it can be used in whatever you need it for.\nDocumentation can be found here: <https://luanti-extended-engine-features.github.io/LEEF-Math/>.\n\nFor possible future contributors: documentation must be generated manually when a commit is made, because I haven't set up workflows (and have no idea how to).\n\n### TODO:\n* Vec3s and Vec2s are not currently adapted for functionality with MT vectors, fix.\n",
